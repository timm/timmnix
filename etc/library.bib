abstract = { Software engineering (SE) truisms capture broadly-applicable principles of software construction. The trouble with truisms is that such general principles may not apply in specific cases. This paper tests the specificity of two SE truisms: (a) increasing software process level is a desirable goal; and (b) it is best to remove errors during the early parts of a software lifecycle. Our tests are based on two well-established SE models: (1) Boehm et.al.'s COCOMO II cost estimation model; and (2) Raffo's discrete event software process model of a software project life cycle. After extensive simulations of these models, the TAR2 treatment learner was applied to find the model parameters that most improved the potential performance of the real-world systems being modelled. The case studies presented here showed that these truisms are clearly sub-optimal for certain projects since other factors proved to be far more critical. Hence, we advise against truism-based process improvement. This paper offers a general alternative framework for model-based assessment of methods to improve software quality: modelling + validation + simulation + sensitivity. That is, after recording what is known in a model, that model should be validated, explored using simulations, then summarized to find the key factors that most improve model behavior.},

abstract = {Information on protein-protein interactions is still mostly limited to a small number of model organisms, and originates from a wide variety of experimental and computational techniques. The database and online resource STRING generalizes access to protein interaction data, by integrating known and predicted interactions from a variety of sources. The underlying infrastructure includes a consistent body of completely sequenced genomes and exhaustive orthology classifications, based on which interaction evidence is transferred between organisms. Although primarily developed for protein interaction analysis, the resource has also been successfully applied to comparative genomics, phylogenetics and network studies, which are all facilitated by programmatic access to the database backend and the availability of compact download files. As of release 7, STRING has almost doubled to 373 distinct organisms, and contains more than 1.5 million proteins for which associations have been pre-computed. Novel features include AJAX-based web-navigation, inclusion of additional resources such as BioGRID, and detailed protein domain annotation. STRING is available at http://string.embl.de/},

With it has come a vast amount of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.},

@article{Boutsidis2008,
abstract = {Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is the predominant linear dimensionality reduction technique, and has been widely applied on datasets in all scientific domains. We consider, both theoretically and empirically, the topic of unsupervised feature selection for PCA, by leveraging algorithms for the so-called Column Subset Selection Problem (CSSP). In words, the CSSP seeks the "best" subset of exactly k columns from an m x n data matrix A, and has been extensively studied in the Numerical Linear Algebra community. We present a novel two-stage algorithm for the CSSP. From a theoretical perspective, for small to moderate values of k, this algorithm significantly improves upon the best previously-existing results 24, 12 for the CSSP. From an empirical perspective, we evaluate this algorithm as an unsupervised feature selection strategy in three application domains of modern statistical data analysis: finance, document-term data, and genetics. We pay particular attention to how this algorithm may be used to select representative or landmark features from an object-feature matrix in an unsupervised manner. In all three application domains, we are able to identify k landmark features, i.e., columns of the data matrix, that capture nearly the same amount of information as does the subspace that is spanned by the top k "eigenfeatures."},

From this model we derive the optimal screening collection make up for a given fixed size of screening collection, and identify the conditions under which a diverse collection of compounds or a collection focusing on particular regions of chemical space are appropriate strategies. We derive from the model a diversity function that may be used to assess compounds for acquisition or libraries for combinatorial synthesis by their ability to complement an existing screening collection. The diversity function is linked directly through the model to the goal of more frequent discovery of lead series from high-throughput screening. We show how the model may also be used to derive relationships between collection size and probabilities of lead discovery in high-throughput screening, and to guide the judicious application of structural filters.},

abstract = {There exists a large and growing number of proposed estimation methods but little conclusive evidence ranking one method over another. Prior effort estimation studies suffered from  conclusion instability , where the rankings offered to different methods were not stable across (a) different evaluation criteria; (b) different data sources; or (c) different random selections of that data. This paper reports a study of 158 effort estimation methods on data sets based on COCOMO features. Four  best  methods were detected that were consistently better than the  rest  of the other 154 methods. These rankings of  best  and  rest  methods were stable across (a) three different evaluation criteria applied to (b) multiple data sets from two different sources that were (c) divided into hundreds of randomly selected subsets using four different random seeds. Hence, while there exists no single universal  best  effort estimation method, there appears to exist a small number (four) of most useful methods. This result both complicates and simplifies effort estimation research. The complication is that any future effort estimation analysis should be preceded by a  selection study  that finds the best local estimator. However, the simplification is that such a study need not be labor intensive, at least for COCOMO style data sets.},

Pick any two". According to that view, is impossibly to optimize on all three criteria without compromising the third. This paper checks that view using an AI search tool called STAR. We show that FBC is indeed feasible and produces similar or better results when compared to other methods However, for FBC to work, there must be a balanced concern and concentration on the quality aspects of a project. If not, "FBC" becomes "CF" (cheaper and faster) with the inevitable lose in project quality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many proposed statistical measures can efficiently compare protein sequence to further infer protein structure, function and evolutionary information. They share the same idea of using k-word frequencies of protein sequences. Given a protein sequence, the information on its related protein sequences hasn't been used for protein sequence comparison until now. This paper proposed a scheme to construct protein 'sequence space' which was associated with protein sequences related to the given protein, and the performances of statistical measures were compared when they explored the information on protein 'sequence space' or not. This paper also presented two statistical measures for protein: gre.k (generalized relative entropy) and gsm.k (gapped similarity measure). RESULTS: We tested statistical measures based on protein 'sequence space' or not with three data sets. This not only offers the systematic and quantitative experimental assessment of these statistical measures, but also naturally complements the available comparison of statistical measures based on protein sequence. Moreover, we compared our statistical measures with alignment-based measures and the existing statistical measures. The experiments were grouped into two sets. The first one, performed via ROC (Receiver Operating Curve) analysis, aims at assessing the intrinsic ability of the statistical measures to discriminate and classify protein sequences. The second set of the experiments aims at assessing how well our measure does in phylogenetic analysis. Based on the experiments, several conclusions can be drawn and, from them, novel valuable guidelines for the use of protein 'sequence space' and statistical measures were obtained. CONCLUSION: Alignment-based measures have a clear advantage when the data is high redundant. The more efficient statistical measure is the novel gsm.k introduced by this article, the cos.k followed. When the data becomes less redundant, gre.k proposed by us achieves a better performance, but all the other measures perform poorly on classification tasks. Almost all the statistical measures achieve improvement by exploring the information on 'sequence space' as word's length increases, especially for less redundant data. The reasonable results of phylogenetic analysis confirm that Gdis.k based on 'sequence space' is a reliable measure for phylogenetic analysis. In summary, our quantitative analysis verifies that exploring the information on 'sequence space' is a promising way to improve the abilities of statistical measures for protein comparison.},

abstract = {Aptamers are ssDNA or RNA oligonucleotides with very high affinity for their target. They bind to the target with high selectivity and specificity because of their specific three-dimensional shape. They are developed by the so-called Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) process. We have modified this method in two steps-use of fluorescent labels for DNA quantification and use of magnetic beads for target immobilization. Thus, radioactive labelling is avoided. Immobilization on magnetic beads enables easy handling, use of very small amounts of target for the aptamer selection, rapid and efficient separation of bound and unbound molecules, and stringent washing steps. We have called this modified SELEX technology FluMag-SELEX. With FluMag-SELEX we have provided a methodological background for our objective of being able to select DNA aptamers for targets with very different properties and size. These aptamers will be applied as new biosensor receptors. In this work selection of streptavidin-specific aptamers by FluMag-SELEX is described. The streptavidin-specific aptamers will be used to check the surface occupancy of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads with biotinylated molecules after immobilization procedures.},

abstract = {Estrogen-related receptors (ERR), ERR alpha (ERR$\alpha$) and ERR gamma (ERR$\gamma$), are orphan nuclear receptors implicated in breast cancer that function similarly in the regulation of oxidative metabolism genes. Paradoxically, in clinical studies, high levels of ERR$\alpha$ are associated with poor outcomes whereas high levels of ERR$\gamma$ are associated with a favorable course. Recent studies suggest that ERR$\alpha$ may indeed promote breast tumor growth. The roles of ERR$\gamma$ in breast cancer progression and how ERR$\alpha$ and ERR$\gamma$ may differentially affect cancer growth are unclear. In mammary carcinoma cells that do not express endogenous ERR$\gamma$, we found that ectopic expression of ERR$\gamma$ enhanced oxidative metabolism in vitro and inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. In contrast, ectopic expression of the ERR$\alpha$ coactivator PGC-1$\alpha$ enhanced oxidative metabolism but did not affect tumor growth. Notably, ERR$\gamma$ activated expression of a genetic program characteristic of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). This program was apparent by changes in cellular morphology, upregulation of epithelial cell markers, downregulation of mesenchymal markers, and decreased cellular invasiveness. We determined that this program was also associated with upregulation of E-cadherin, which is activated directly by ERR$\gamma$. In contrast, PGC-1$\alpha$ activated only a subset of genes characteristic of the MET program and, unlike ERR$\gamma$, did not upregulate E-cadherin. In conclusion, these results show that ERR$\gamma$ induces E-cadherin, promotes MET, and suppresses breast cancer growth. Our findings suggest that ERR$\gamma$ agonists may have applications in the treatment of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Statistical pattern recognition is a very active area of study and research, which has seen many advances in recent years. New and emerging applications - such as data mining, web searching, multimedia data retrieval, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition - require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. Statistical decision making and estimation are regarded as fundamental to the study of pattern recognition.Statistical Pattern Recognition, Second Edition has been fully updated with new methods, applications and references. It provides a comprehensive introduction to this vibrant area - with material drawn from engineering, statistics, computer science and the social sciences - and covers many application areas, such as database design, artificial neural networks, and decision support systems.* Provides a self-contained introduction to statistical pattern recognition.* Each technique described is illustrated by real examples.* Covers Bayesian methods, neural networks, support vector machines, and unsupervised classification.* Each section concludes with a description of the applications that have been addressed and with further developments of the theory.* Includes background material on dissimilarity, parameter estimation, data, linear algebra and probability.* Features a variety of exercises, from 'open-book' questions to more lengthy projects.The book is aimed primarily at senior undergraduate and graduate students studying statistical pattern recognition, pattern processing, neural networks, and data mining, in both statistics and engineering departments. It is also an excellent source of reference for technical professionals working in advanced information development environments.For further information on the techniques and applications discussed in this book please visit www.statistical-pattern-recognition.net},

abstract = {SELEX stands for systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. This method, described primarily in 1990 [Ellington, A.D., Szostak, J.W., 1990. In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands. Nature 346, 818-822; Tuerk, C., Gold, L., 1990. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. Science 249, 505-510] aims at the development of aptamers, which are oligonucleotides (RNA or ssDNA) binding to their target with high selectivity and sensitivity because of their three-dimensional shape. Aptamers are all new ligands with a high affinity for considerably differing molecules ranging from large targets as proteins over peptides, complex molecules to drugs and organic small molecules or even metal ions. Aptamers are widely used, including medical and pharmaceutical basic research, drug development, diagnosis, and therapy. Analytical and separation tools bearing aptamers as molecular recognition and binding elements are another big field of application. Moreover, aptamers are used for the investigation of binding phenomena in proteomics. The SELEX method was modified over the years in different ways to become more efficient and less time consuming, to reach higher affinities of the aptamers selected and for automation of the process. This review is focused on the development of aptamers by use of SELEX and gives an overview about technologies, advantages, limitations, and applications of aptamers. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The Team Software ProcessSM (TSPSM) provides a framework that teams use to collect software process data in real time, using a defined disciplined process. This data holds promise for use in software engineering research. We combined data from 109 industrial projects into a database to support performance benchmarking and model development. But is the data of sufficient quality to draw conclusions? We applied various tests and techniques to identify data anomalies that affect the quality of the data in several dimensions. In this paper, we report some initial results of our analysis, describing the amount and the rates of identified anomalies and suspect data, including incorrectness, inconsistency, and credibility. To illustrate the types of data available for analysis, we provide three examples. The preliminary results of this empirical study suggest that some aspects of the data quality are good and the data are generally credible, but size data are often missing},

abstract = {Bug localization is the task of determining which source code$\backslash$nentities are relevant to a bug report. Manual bug localization is labor$\backslash$nintensive since developers must consider thousands of source code$\backslash$nentities. Current research builds bug localization classifiers, based on$\backslash$ninformation retrieval models, to locate entities that are textually$\backslash$nsimilar to the bug report. Current research, however, does not consider$\backslash$nthe effect of classifier configuration, i.e., all the parameter values$\backslash$nthat specify the behavior of a classifier. As such, the effect of each$\backslash$nparameter or which parameter values lead to the best performance is$\backslash$nunknown. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effectiveness of$\backslash$na large space of classifier configurations, 3,172 in total. Further, we$\backslash$nintroduce a framework for combining the results of multiple classifier$\backslash$nconfigurations since classifier combination has shown promise in other$\backslash$ndomains. Through a detailed case study on over 8,000 bug reports from$\backslash$nthree large-scale projects, we make two main contributions. First, we$\backslash$nshow that the parameters of a classifier have a significant impact on$\backslash$nits performance. Second, we show that combining multiple$\backslash$nclassifiers--whether those classifiers are hand-picked or randomly$\backslash$nchosen relative to intelligently defined subspaces of$\backslash$nclassifiers--improves the performance of even the best individual$\backslash$nclassifiers.},

In the present review, the separation methods used in such SELEX processes are reviewed.},

abstract = {Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

abstract = {Before performing drastic changes to a project, it is worthwhile to thoroughly explore the available options within the current structure of a project. An alternative to drastic change are internal changes that adjust current options within a software project. In this paper, we show that the effects of numerous internal changes can out-weigh the effects of drastic changes. That is, the benefits of drastic change can often be achieved without disrupting a project. The key to our technique is SEESAW, a novel stochastic stability tool that (a) considers a very large set of minor changes using stochastic sampling; and (b) carefully selects the right combination of effective minor changes. Our results show, using SEESAW, project managers have more project improvement options than they currently realize. This result should be welcome news to managers struggling to maintain control and continuity over their project in the face of multiple demands for drastic change.},

In the unsupervised case, it performs consistently with other spectral clustering algorithms. In the supervised case, our approach achieves high accuracy on the categorization of thousands of documents given only a few dozen labeled training documents for the 20 Newsgroups data set. Furthermore, its classification accuracy increases with the addition of unlabeled documents, demonstrating effective use of unlabeled data. By using normalized affinity matrices which are both symmetric and stochastic, we also obtain both a probabilistic interpretation of our method and certain guarantees of performance.},

abstract = {The mantra of the PROMISE series is "repeatable, improvable, maybe refutable" software engineering experiments. This community has successfully created a library of reusable software engineering data sets. The next challenge in the PROMISE community will be to not only share data, but to share experiments. Our experience with existing data mining environments is that these tools are not suitable for publishing or sharing repeatable experiments. OURMINE is an environment for the development of data mining experiments. OURMINE offers a succinct notation for describing experiments. Adding new tools to OURMINE, in a variety of languages, is a rapid and simple process. This makes it a useful research tool. Complicated graphical interfaces have been eschewed for simple command-line prompts. This simplifies the learning curve for data mining novices. The simplicity also encourages large scale modification and experimentation with the code. In this paper, we show the OURMINE code required to reproduce a recent experiment checking how defect predictors learned from one site apply to another. This is an important result for the PROMISE community since it shows that our shared repository is not just a useful academic resource. Rather, it is a valuable resource industry: companies that lack the local data required to build those predictors can use PROMISE data to build defect predictors.},

abstract = {There are two crucial problems with statistical measures for sequence comparison: overlapping structures and background information of words in biological sequences. Word normalization in improved composition vector method took into account these problems and achieved better performance in evolutionary analysis. The word normalization is desirable, but not sufficient, because it assumes that the four bases A, C, T, and G occur randomly with equal chance. This paper proposed an improved word normalization which uses Markov model to estimate exact k-word distribution according to observed biological sequence and thus has the ability to adjust the background information of the k-word frequencies in biological sequences. The improved word normalization was tested with three experiments and compared with the existing word normalization. The experiment results confirm that the improved word normalization using Markov model to estimate the exact k-word distribution in biological sequences is more efficient.},

With the categorizing framework, we continue our efforts toward building an integrated system for intelligent feature selection. A unifying platform is proposed as an intermediate step. An illustrative example is presented to show how existing feature selection algorithms can be integrated into a meta algorithm that can take advantage of individual algorithms. An added advantage of doing so is to help a user employ a suitable algorithm without knowing details of each algorithm. Some real-world applications are included to demonstrate the use of feature selection in data mining. We conclude this work by identifying trends and challenges of feature selection research and development.},

Experimental procedures used by the studies$\backslash$nd iffered making it impossible to undertake formal meta-analysis$\backslash$nof the results.

abstract = {In this article we describe an ongoing effort to integrate information visualization techniques into the process of configuration management for software systems. Our focus is to help software engineers manage the evolution of large and complex software systems by offering them effective and efficient ways to query and assess system properties using visual techniques. To this end, we combine several techniques from different domains, as follows. First, we construct an infrastructure that allows generic querying and data mining of different types of software repositories such as CVS and Subversion. Using this infrastructure, we construct several models of the software source code evolution at different levels of detail, ranging from project and package up to function and code line. Second, we describe a set of views that allow examining the code evolution models at different levels of detail and from different perspectives. We detail three views: the file view shows changes at line level across many versions of a single, or a few, files. The project view shows changes at file level across entire software projects. The decomposition view shows changes at subsystem level across entire projects. We illustrate how the proposed techniques, which we implemented in a fully operational toolset, have been used to answer non-trivial questions on several real-world, industry-size software projects. Our work is at the crossroads of applied software engineering (SE) and information visualization, as our toolset aims to tightly integrate the methods promoted by the InfoVis field into the SE practice.},

abstract = {Lipinski and others, through concepts such as drug-likeness, re-focussed drug discovery back to the principles of medicinal chemistry in the high-throughput era as key to reducing attrition. More recently, the need to go further in defining what makes a good lead has been recognised with the concept of leadlikeness. Leadlikeness implies cut-off values in the physico-chemical profile of chemical libraries such that they have reduced complexity (e.g. MW below <400) and other more restricted properties. We examine these concepts in the context of Virtual (theoretically possible), Tangible (chemically feasible) and Real (physically available) worlds of molecules. In a thought experiment, we take the HTS concept to the extreme: screening an estimated 60 million 'Global Collection' on 5000 targets and realising that perhaps millions of drug candidates might be found that could not possibly be handled in reality. Sampling of the Virtual and Tangible worlds is therefore a necessity. We show that the world of Reals is significantly under-sampled as the MW of compounds increases. This supports the design and screening of 'reduced complexity' (leadlike) compound libraries, preferably with synthetic handles available for rapid chemical iteration and detected as interesting by careful screening or biophysical assays.},

In this paper, we investigate whether metrics available early in the development lifecycle can be used to identify fault-prone software modules. More precisely, we build predictive models using the metrics that characterize textual requirements. We compare the performance of requirements-based models against the performance of code-based models and models that combine requirement and code metrics. Using a range of modeling techniques and the data from three NASA projects, our study indicates that the early lifecycle metrics can play an important role in project management, either by pointing to the need for increased quality monitoring during the development or by using the models to assign verification and validation activities.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach for clustering—pattern preserving clustering—which produces more easily interpretable and usable clusters. This approach is motivated by the following observation: while there are usually strong patterns in the data—patterns that may be key for the analysis and description of the data—these patterns are often split among different clusters by current clustering approaches. This is, perhaps, not surprising, since clustering algorithms have no built-in knowledge of these patterns and may often have goals that are in conflict with preserving patterns, e.g., minimize the distance of points to their nearest cluster centroids. In this paper, our focus is to characterize (1) the benefits of pattern preserving clustering and (2) the most effective way of performing pattern preserving clustering. To that end, we propose and evaluate two clustering algorithms, HIerarchical Clustering with pAttern Preservation (HICAP) and bisecting K-means Clustering with pAttern Preservation (K-CAP). Experimental results on document data show that HICAP can produce overlapping clusters that preserve useful patterns, but has relatively worse clustering performance than bisecting K-means with respect to the clustering evaluation criterion of entropy. By contrast, in terms of entropy, K-CAP can perform substantially better than the bisecting K-means algorithm when data sets contain clusters of widely different sizes—a common situation in the real-world. Most importantly, we also illustrate how patterns, if preserved, can aid cluster interpretation.

abstract = {Word-based models have achieved promising results in sequence comparison. However, as the important statistical properties of words in biological sequence, how to use the overlapping structures and background information of the words to improve sequence comparison is still a problem. This paper proposed a new statistical method that integrates the overlapping structures and the background information of the words in biological sequences. To assess the effectiveness of this integration for sequence comparison, two sets of evaluation experiments were taken to test the proposed model. The first one, performed via receiver operating curve analysis, is the application of proposed method in discrimination between functionally related regulatory sequences and unrelated sequences, intron and exon. The second experiment is to evaluate the performance of the proposed method with f-measure for clustering Hepatitis E virus genotypes. It was demonstrated that the proposed method integrating the overlapping structures and the background information of words significantly improves biological sequence comparison and outperforms the existing models.},

abstract = {Software development effort estimation is the process of predicting the most realistic use of effort required for developing software based on some parameters. It has always characterised one of the biggest challenges in Computer Science for the last decades. Because time and cost estimate at the early stages of the software development are the most difficult to obtain, and they are often the least accurate. Traditional algorithmic techniques such as regression models, Software Life Cycle Management (SLIM), COCOMO model, function points, etc, require an estimation process in a long term. But, nowadays that is not acceptable for software developers and companies. Newer soft computing techniques to effort estimation based on non-algorithmic techniques such as Fuzzy Logic (FL) may offer an alternative for solving the problem. This work aims to propose a fuzzy logic realistic model to achieve more accuracy in software effort estimation. In this innovative model, by applying fuzzy logic and using training procedure to the system, the accuracy of the results is desirable in comparison with the famous traditional algorithmic technique, COCOMO II model. This novelty model will lead researchers to focus on non-algorithmic models to overcome the estimation problems. Our validation experiment was carried out on artificial dataset as well as the COCOMO standard dataset.},

Hence, we avoid the theoretical problem of incompleteness, provided that testing continues until after the saturation point.

abstract = {Ensemble methods have emerged as a powerful method for improving the robustness as well as the accuracy of both supervised and unsupervised solutions. Moreover, as enormous amounts of data are continuously generated from different views, it is important to consolidate different concepts for intelligent decision making. In the past decade, there have been numerous studies on the problem of combining competing models into a committee, and the success of ensemble techniques has been observed in multiple disciplines, including recommendation systems, anomaly detection, stream mining, and web applications. The ensemble techniques have been mostly studied in supervised and unsupervised learning communities separately. However, they share the same basic principles, i.e., combination of diversified base models strengthens weak models. Also, when both supervised and unsupervised models are available for a single task, merging all of the results leads to better performances. Therefore, there is a need of a systematic introduction and comparison of the ensemble techniques, combining the views of both supervised and unsupervised learning ensembles. In this tutorial, we will present an organized picture on ensemble methods with a focus on the mechanism to merge the results. We start with the description and applications of ensemble methods. Through reviews of well-known and state-of-the-art ensemble methods, we show that supervised learning ensembles usually learn" this mechanism based on the available labels in the training data, whereas unsupervised ensembles simply combine multiple clustering solutions based on consensus". We end the tutorial with a systematic approach to combine both supervised and unsupervised models, and several applications of ensemble methods.},

abstract = {The ability to determine the location and relative strength of all transcription-factor binding sites in a genome is important both for a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation and for effective promoter engineering in biotechnological applications. Here we present a bioinformatically driven experimental method to accurately define the DNA-binding sequence specificity of transcription factors. A generalized profile was used as a predictive quantitative model for binding sites, and its parameters were estimated from in vitro-selected ligands using standard hidden Markov model training algorithms. Computer simulations showed that several thousand low- to medium-affinity sequences are required to generate a profile of desired accuracy. To produce data on this scale, we applied high-throughput genomics methods to the biochemical problem addressed here. A method combining systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) protocols was coupled to an automated quality-controlled sequence extraction procedure based on Phred quality scores. This allowed the sequencing of a database of more than 10,000 potential DNA ligands for the CTF/NFI transcription factor. The resulting binding-site model defines the sequence specificity of this protein with a high degree of accuracy not achieved earlier and thereby makes it possible to identify previously unknown regulatory sequences in genomic DNA. A covariance analysis of the selected sites revealed non-independent base preferences at different nucleotide positions, providing insight into the binding mechanism.},

abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) is well known as a simple and efficient scheme for global optimization over continuous spaces. It has reportedly outperformed a few evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and other search heuristics like the particle swarm optimization (PSO) when tested over both benchmark and real-world problems. DE, however, is not completely free from the problems of slow and/or premature convergence. This paper describes a family of improved variants of the DE/target-to-best/1/bin scheme, which utilizes the concept of the neighborhood of each population member. The idea of small neighborhoods, defined over the index-graph of parameter vectors, draws inspiration from the community of the PSO algorithms. The proposed schemes balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of DE without imposing serious additional burdens in terms of function evaluations. They are shown to be statistically significantly better than or at least comparable to several existing DE variants as well as a few other significant evolutionary computing techniques over a test suite of 24 benchmark functions. The paper also investigates the applications of the new DE variants to two real-life problems concerning parameter estimation for frequency modulated sound waves and spread spectrum radar poly-phase code design.},

These measurements are generated continuously and in a very high fluctuating data rates. Examples include sensor networks, web logs, and computer network traffic. The storage, querying and mining of such data sets are highly computationally challenging tasks. Mining data streams is concerned with extracting knowledge structures represented in models and patterns in non stopping streams of information. The research in data stream mining has gained a high attraction due to the importance of its applications and the increasing generation of streaming information. Applications of data stream analysis can vary from critical scientific and astronomical applications to important business and financial ones. Algorithms, systems and frameworks that address streaming challenges have been developed over the past three years. In this review paper, we present the state-of-the-art in this growing vital field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recognizing regulatory sequences in genomes is a continuing challenge, despite a wealth of available genomic data and a growing number of experimentally validated examples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We discuss here a simple approach to search for regulatory sequences based on the compositional similarity of genomic regions and known cis-regulatory sequences. This method, which is not limited to searching for predefined motifs, recovers sequences known to be under similar regulatory control. The words shared by the recovered sequences often correspond to known binding sites. Furthermore, we show that although local word profile clustering is predictive for the regulatory sequences involved in blastoderm segmentation, local dissimilarity is a more universal feature of known regulatory sequences in Drosophila. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our method leverages sequence motifs within a known regulatory sequence to identify co-regulated sequences without explicitly defining binding sites. We also show that regulatory sequences can be distinguished from surrounding sequences by local sequence dissimilarity, a novel feature in identifying regulatory sequences across a genome.

abstract = {For applications of data mining techniques in geosciences, through mining spatial databases which are constructed with geophysical and geochemical data measured in fields, critical knowledge, such as the spatial distribution of geological targets, the geophysical and geochemical characteristics of geological targets, the differentiation among the geological targets, and the relationship among geophysical and geochemical data, can be discovered. Due to the complexity of geophysical and geochemical data, traditional mining methods of cluster analysis and association analysis have limitations in processing complex data. In this paper, a clustering algorithm based on density and adaptive density-reachable is presented which has the ability to handle clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes, and densities. For association analysis, mining the continuous attributes may reveal useful and interesting insights about the data objects in geoscientific applications. An approach for distance-based quantitative association analysis is presented in this paper. Experiments and applications indicate that the algorithm and approach are effective in real-world applications. },

Knowledge engineers must model not only descriptions of expert knowledge, but also the environment in which a knowledge base will perform. Descriptions of knowledge must be constantly re-evaluated.

The knowledge-acquisition workshops that responded to this interest led to the formation of a vibrant research community that has achieved remarkable consensus on a number of issues. These viewpoints include (1) the rejection of the notion of knowledge as a commodity to be transferred from one locus to another, (2) an acceptance of the situated nature of human expertise, (3) emphasis on knowledge acquisition as the modeling of problem solving, and (4) the pursuit of reusable patterns in problem solving and in domain descriptions that can facilitate both modeling and system implementation.

abstract = {Software systems are designed and engineered to process data. However, software is data too. The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. Software evolution is no longer just about writing code, it is becoming an information management problem.
Analysis and management of the software data are activities that software engineers are not trained to do. We have to look for solutions outside software engineering, adopt them, and make them our own. These solutions can come from data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, statistical analysis, etc. This is not the first time software engineers are looking at such solutions. It has been going on for about two decades, in a form or another. The results so far indicate that software engineering is facing a paradigm shift, where more and more software engineering tasks are reinterpreted as optimization, search, retrieval, or classification problems. Despite this experience, applications of data analysis, data integration, and data mining in software engineering are in their infancy by comparison with other research fields. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created. This research has to be supported by integration with software development processes and with education as well. More than that, in order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners.
The talk will focus on arguing for and mapping out (part of) this research agenda, while looking back at (some of) the existing work in the area.},

abstract = {We propose EMD-L1: a fast and exact algorithm for computing the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between a pair of histograms. The efficiency of the new algorithm enables its application to problems that were previously prohibitive due to high time complexities. The proposed EMD-L1 significantly simplifies the original linear programming formulation of EMD. Exploiting the L1 metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L1 is reduced to O(N) from O(N2) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L1 formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L1 ground distance. To perform the EMD-L1 computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L1 as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N2), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L1 is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise. The results demonstrate that our EMD-L1-based solutions outperform previously reported state-of-the-art features and distance measures in solving the two tasks.},

abstract = {Success in small molecule screening relies heavily on the preselection of compounds. Here, we present a strategy for the enrichment of chemical libraries with potentially bioactive compounds integrating the collected knowledge of medicinal chemistry. Employing a genetic algorithm, substructures typically occurring in bioactive compounds were identified using the World Drug Index. Availability of compounds containing the selected substructures was analysed in vendor libraries, and the substructure-specific sublibraries were assembled. Compounds containing reactive, undesired functional groups were omitted. Using a diversity filter for both physico-chemical properties and the substructure composition, the compounds of all the sublibraries were ranked. Accordingly, a screening collection of 16,671 compounds was selected. Diversity and chemical space coverage of the collection indicate that it is highly diverse and well-placed in the chemical space spanned by bioactive compounds. Furthermore, secondary assay-validated hits presented in this study show the practical relevance of our library design strategy.},

abstract = {Prediction of fault prone software components is one of the most researched$\backslash$nproblems in software engineering. Many statistical techniques have$\backslash$nbeen proposed but there is no consensus on the methodology to select$\backslash$nthe ``best model" for the specific project. In this paper, we introduce$\backslash$nand discuss the merits of cost curve analysis of fault prediction$\backslash$nmodels. Cost curves allow software quality engineers to introduce$\backslash$nproject-specific cost of module misclassification into model evaluation.$\backslash$nClassifying a software module as fault-prone implies the application$\backslash$nof some verification activities, thus adding to the development cost.$\backslash$nMisclassifying a module as fault free carries the risk of system$\backslash$nfailure, also associated with cost implications. Through the analysis$\backslash$nof sixteen projects from public repositories, we observe that software$\backslash$nquality does not necessarily benefit from the prediction of fault$\backslash$nprone components. The inclusion of misclassification cost in model$\backslash$nevaluation may indicate that even the ``best" models achieve performance$\backslash$nno better than trivial classification. Our results support a recommendation$\backslash$nfavoring the use of cost curves in practice with the hope they will$\backslash$nbecome a standard tool for software quality model performance evaluation.},

abstract = { We present an approach to matching software practitioners' needs to software researchers' activities. It uses an accepted taxonomical software classification scheme as intermediary, in terms of which practitioners express needs, and researchers express activities. A decision support tool is used to combine these expressions of needs/activities, and to assist in studying the implications of that combined knowledge. This enables identification of fruitful connections between researchers and practitioners, of areas of common interest among researchers, and practitioners, and of "gaps": areas of unfulfilled needs or unmotivated research. We discuss the software engineering underpinning this approach, illustrating its utility by reporting on experiments with a real-world dataset gathered from researchers and practitioners. We also suggest that this same approach would be applicable to understanding the distribution of interests represented by presenters and attendees of a conference such as APSEC.},

Hence, it is not enough to just generate solutions to requirements problems- we must also assess solution robustness. The KEYS2 algorithm can generate decision ordering diagrams. Once generated, these diagrams can assess solution robustness in linear time. In experiments with real-world requirements engineering models, we show that KEYS2 can generate decision ordering diagrams in O(N             2). When assessed in terms of terms of (a) reducing inference times, (b) increasing solution quality, and (c) decreasing the variance of the generated solution, KEYS2 out-performs other search algorithms (simulated annealing, ASTAR, MaxWalkSat).},

abstract = {Large media collections rapidly evolve in the World Wide Web. In addition to the targeted retrieval as is performed by search engines, browsing and explorative navigation is an important issue. Since the collections grow fast and authors most often do not annotate their web pages according to a given ontology, automatic structuring is in demand as a prerequisite for any pleasant human-computer interface. In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding alternative high-quality structures for navigation in a large collection of high-dimensional data. We express desired properties of frequent termset clustering \{(FTS)\} in terms of objective functions. In general, these functions are conflicting. This leads to the formulation of \{FTS\} clustering as a multi-objective optimization problem. The optimization is solved by a genetic algorithm. The result is a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Users may choose their favorite type of a structure for their navigation through a collection or explore the different views given by the different optimal solutions. We explore the capability of the new approach to produce structures that are well suited for browsing on a social bookmarking data set.},

abstract = {Clustering in high-dimensional spaces is a difficult problem which is recurrent in many domains, for example in image analysis. The difficulty is due to the fact that high-dimensional data usually exist in different low-dimensional subspaces hidden in the original space. A family of Gaussian mixture models designed for high-dimensional data which combine the ideas of subspace clustering and parsimonious modeling are presented. These models give rise to a clustering method based on the expectationmaximization algorithm which is called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC). In order to correctly fit the data, HDDC estimates the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of each group. Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that HDDC outperforms existing methods for clustering high-dimensional data.},

abstract = {Customer churn prediction models aim to detect customers with a high propensity to attrite. Predictive accuracy, comprehensibility, and justifiability are three key aspects of a churn prediction model. An accurate model permits to correctly target future churners in a retention marketing campaign, while a comprehensible and intuitive rule-set allows to identify the main drivers for customers to churn, and to develop an effective retention strategy in accordance with domain knowledge. This paper provides an extended overview of the literature on the use of data mining in customer churn prediction modeling. It is shown that only limited attention has been paid to the comprehensibility and the intuitiveness of churn prediction models. Therefore, two novel data mining techniques are applied to churn prediction modeling, and benchmarked to traditional rule induction techniques such as C4.5 and RIPPER. Both AntMiner+ and ALBA are shown to induce accurate as well as comprehensible classification rule-sets. AntMiner+ is a high performing data mining technique based on the principles of Ant Colony Optimization that allows to include domain knowledge by imposing monotonicity constraints on the final rule-set. ALBA on the other hand combines the high predictive accuracy of a non-linear support vector machine model with the comprehensibility of the rule-set format. The results of the benchmarking experiments show that ALBA improves learning of classification techniques, resulting in comprehensible models with increased performance. AntMiner+ results in accurate, comprehensible, but most importantly justifiable models, unlike the other modeling techniques included in this study. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper discusses the weighting of fragments on the basis of their frequencies of occurrence in molecules. Extensive experiments with sets of active molecules from the MDL Drug Data Report and the World of Molecular Bioactivity databases, using fingerprints encoding Tripos holograms, Pipeline Pilot ECFC\_4 circular substructures and Sunset Molecular keys, demonstrate clearly that frequency-based screening is generally more effective than conventional, unweighted screening. The results suggest that standardising the raw occurrence frequencies by taking the square root of the frequencies will maximise the effectiveness of virtual screening. An upper-bound analysis shows the complex interactions that can take place between representations, weighting schemes and similarity coefficients when similarity measures are computed, and provides a rationalisation of the relative performance of the various weighting schemes.},

abstract = {The problem of finding association rules in a large data- base of sales transactions has been widely studied in the literature, We discuss some of the weaknesses of the large itemset method for association rule generation. A differ- ent method for evaluating and finding itemsets referred to as otrongIyl collective itemsets is proposed. The concepts of “support” of an itemset and correlation of the items within an itemset are related, though not quite the same. This cri- terion stresses the importance of the actual correlation of the items with one another rather than the absolute sup- port, Previously proposed methods to provide correlated itemsets are not necessarily applicable to very large data- bases, We provide an algorithm which provides very good computational efficiency, while maintaining statistical ro- buetneas, The fact that this algorithm relies on relative measures rather than absolute measures such as support also implies that the method can be applied to find association rules in datasets in which items may appear in a sizeable percentage of the transactions (dense datasets), datasets in which the items have varying density, or even negative as- sociation rules,},

abstract = {Reliable effort estimation remains an ongoing challenge to software engineers. Accurate effort estimation is the state of art of software engineering, effort estimation of software is the preliminary phase between the client and the business enterprise. The relationship between the client and the business enterprise begins with the estimation of the software. The credibility of the client to the business enterprise increases with the accurate estimation. Effort estimation often requires generalizing from a small number of historical projects. Generalization from such limited experience is an inherently under constrained problem. Accurate estimation is a complex process because it can be visualized as software effort prediction, as the term indicates prediction never becomes an actual. This work follows the basics of the empirical software effort estimation models. The goal of this paper is to study the empirical software effort estimation. The primary conclusion is that no single technique is best for all situations, and that a careful comparison of the results of several approaches is most likely to produce realistic estimates.},

Its usefulness in characterizing experimental data which stem from very high dimensional systems is stressed. Algorithms for extracting v from the time series of a single variable are proposed. The relations between the various measures of strange attractors and between them and the Lyapunov exponents are discussed. It is shown that the conjecture of Kaplan and Yorke for the dimension gives an upper bound for v. Various examples of finite and infinite dimensional systems are treated, both numerically and analytically.},

abstract = {We propose a practical defect prediction approach for companies that do not track defect related data. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of cross-company (CC) data for building localized defect predictors using static code features. Firstly, we analyze the conditions, where CC data can be used as is. These conditions turn out to be quite few. Then we apply principles of analogy-based learning (i.e. nearest neighbor (NN) filtering) to CC data, in order to fine tune these models for localization. We compare the performance of these models with that of defect predictors learned from within-company (WC) data. As expected, we observe that defect predictors learned from WC data outperform the ones learned from CC data. However, our analyses also yield defect predictors learned from NN-filtered CC data, with performance close to, but still not better than, WC data. Therefore, we perform a final analysis for determining the minimum number of local defect reports in order to learn WC defect predictors. We demonstrate in this paper that the minimum number of data samples required to build effective defect predictors can be quite small and can be collected quickly within a few months. Hence, for companies with no local defect data, we recommend a two-phase approach that allows them to employ the defect prediction process instantaneously. In phase one, companies should use NN-filtered CC data to initiate the defect prediction process and simultaneously start collecting WC (local) data. Once enough WC data is collected (i.e. after a few months), organizations should switch to phase two and use predictors learned from WC data.},

This paper describes two techniques for enhancing the effectiveness of screening: the use of a second-level search based on the nearest neighbours of the initial reference structure; and the use of weighted fingerprints encoding the frequency of occurrence, rather than just the mere presence, of substructures. Experiments using several databases for which both structural and bioactivity data are available demonstrate the effectiveness of these two approaches.},

abstract = {This paper concerns approximate nearest neighbor searching algorithms, which have become increasingly important, especially in high dimen- sional perception areas such as computer vision, with dozens of publica- tions in recent years. Much of this enthusiasm is due to a successful new approximate nearest neighbor approach called Locality Sensitive Hash- ing (LSH). In this paper we ask the question: can earlier spatial data structure approaches to exact nearest neighbor, such as metric trees, be altered to provide approximate answers to proximity queries and if so, how? We introduce a new kind of metric tree that allows overlap: certain datapoints may appear in both the children of a parent. We also intro- duce new approximate k-NN search algorithms on this structure. We show why these structures should be able to exploit the same random- projection-based approximations that LSH enjoys, but with a simpler al- gorithm and perhaps with greater efficiency. We then provide a detailed empirical evaluation on five large, high dimensional datasets which show up to 31-fold accelerations over LSH. This result holds true throughout the spectrum of approximation levels.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a 'forward-looking' decision support framework that integrates up-to-date metrics data with simulation models of the software development process in order to support the software project management control function. This forward-looking approach (called the PROMPT method) provides predictions of project performance and the impact of various management decisions. Tradeoffs among performance measures are accomplished using outcome based control limits (OBCLs) and are augmented using multi-criteria utility functions and financial measures of performance to evaluate various process alternatives. The decision support framework enables the program manager to plan, manage and track current software development activities in the short term and to take corrective action as necessary to bring the project back on track. The model provides insight on potential performance impacts of the proposed corrective actions. A real world example utilizing a software process simulation model is presented. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

among the rest, that the problem of comprehensibility is complicated by
a complex context due to a diversity of problem domain attributes, user
and task characteristics, algorithmic methods, and concurrency of user
goals. Solutions to problems of discovered patterns that are not easy to
interpret and validate may involve integration of available information
technologies, and utilization of multiple information types and sources.
An investigation of comprehensibility issues may benefit from the
adoption of multiple definitions in relation to this concept},

abstract = {Increasingly, chemical libraries are being produced which are focused on a biological target or group of related targets, rather than simply being constructed in a combinatorial fashion. A screening collection compiled from such libraries will contain multiple analogues of a number of discrete series of compounds. The question arises as to how many analogues are necessary to represent each series in order to ensure that an active series will be identified. Based on a simple probabilistic argument and supported by in-house screening data, guidelines are given for the number of compounds necessary to achieve a "hit", or series of hits, at various levels of certainty. Obtaining more than one hit from the same series is useful since this gives early acquisition of SAR (structure-activity relationship) and confirms a hit is not a singleton. We show that screening collections composed of only small numbers of analogues of each series are sub-optimal for SAR acquisition. Based on these studies, we recommend a minimum series size of about 200 compounds. This gives a high probability of confirmatory SAR (i.e. at least two hits from the same series). More substantial early SAR (at least 5 hits from the same series) can be gained by using series of about 650 compounds each. With this level of information being generated, more accurate assessment of the likely success of the series in hit-to-lead and later stage development becomes possible.},

abstract = {High throughput screening (HTS) has become the cornerstone of lead identification for small molecules in drug discovery during the last quarter century. The evolution of the sciences and technologies that have evolved as the foundation of modern HTS campaigns are complex and require multidisciplinary interactions. Innovations in integrated automated systems, reagent systems enabled by molecular biology, computational capabilities, and visualization tools have converged to provide sophisticated tools to HTS practitioners. The success of HTS in an organi- zation does not rest solely with those performing HTS but is critically dependent on the interactions of biology and chemistry members of the multidisciplinary teams throughout the early discovery process. Thus a basic knowledge and understanding of the components and processes of HTS is a necessary requirement for effective communication in planning, executing, and analyzing an HTS campaign. This chapter addresses the key components of HTS campaigns, common approaches, and related issues that should be understood by those engaged in small molecule drug discovery.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In recent years, there have been various efforts to overcome the limitations of standard clustering approaches for the analysis of gene expression data by grouping genes and samples simultaneously. The underlying concept, which is often referred to as biclustering, allows to identify sets of genes sharing compatible expression patterns across subsets of samples, and its usefulness has been demonstrated for different organisms and datasets. Several biclustering methods have been proposed in the literature; however, it is not clear how the different techniques compare with each other with respect to the biological relevance of the clusters as well as with other characteristics such as robustness and sensitivity to noise. Accordingly, no guidelines concerning the choice of the biclustering method are currently available. RESULTS: First, this paper provides a methodology for comparing and validating biclustering methods that includes a simple binary reference model. Although this model captures the essential features of most biclustering approaches, it is still simple enough to exactly determine all optimal groupings; to this end, we propose a fast divide-and-conquer algorithm (Bimax). Second, we evaluate the performance of five salient biclustering algorithms together with the reference model and a hierarchical clustering method on various synthetic and real datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. The comparison reveals that (1) biclustering in general has advantages over a conventional hierarchical clustering approach, (2) there are considerable performance differences between the tested methods and (3) already the simple reference model delivers relevant patterns within all considered settings.},

abstract = {Recent literature has demonstrated the applicability of genetic programming to induction of decision trees for modelling toxicity endpoints. Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

Menzies and Di Stefano apply a number of data mining tools to the data set. While, inmost cases, their results are in agreement with ours, in some cases they are not. Our first and main observation is that our interpretation of the data set is based not only on the data set itself but also on the knowledge gathered during the interviews with project members. The main problem with the data set is its size: 23 data points. Although this data set is the largest one available about reuse projects, it is too limited to base analysis only on data mining techniques; data mining is usually applied to data sets with thousands if not millions of data points.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that the total cost of employing joint replenishment for correlated items is less than the total cost of using single-item replenishment. Savings increase dramatically when the demand between items is closely related. Although the benefits of joint replenishment are significant, it is difficult to define the demand correlation among items, especially when the number of items increases. A large number of items reduces the efficiency and advantage of the multi-item inventory control. To overcome this difficulty, an association clustering algorithm this paper proposes to evaluate the correlated demands among items. The proposed algorithm utilizes the "support" concept in association rule analysis to measure the similarity among items. Based on these measurements a clustering method is developed to group items with close demand in a hierarchal way. The can-order policy is then applied to the optimal clustering result as decided by the proposed performance index. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed association clustering algorithm for replenishment systems, a set of simulations and a sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results of the experiments show that the proposed method outperforms several replenishment models. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we present an LMDS ensemble where we use a portion of the input in a piecewise manner to solve classical MDS, combining individual LMDS solutions which operate on different partitions of the input. Ground control points (GCPs) that are shared by partitions considered in the ensemble, allow us to align individual LMDS solutions in a common coordinate system through affine transformations. We incorporate priors into combining multiple LMDS solutions such that the weighted averaging by priors improves the noise-robustness of our method. Our LMDS ensemble is much less noise-sensitive while maintaining the scalability and the speed of LMDS. Experiments on synthetic data (noisy grid) and real-world data (similar image retrieval) confirm the high performance of the proposed LMDS ensemble. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ritchie2010a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of family history in identifying children with severe or genetic hyperlipidemias in a rural, predominantly white population. METHODS: A total of 20,266 fifth-grade children in West Virginia, from the Coronary Artery Risk Detection in Appalachian Communities (CARDIAC) Project, who completed a family history and fasting lipid profile were used in analyses. The relationship between hyperlipidemia and family history was determined, and the use of family history to predict the need for pharmacologic treatment among children with dyslipidemia was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 71.4\% of children met the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines for cholesterol screening on the basis of positive family history. Of those, 1204 (8.3\%) were considered to have dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein > or =130 mg/dL), and 1.2\% of these children with dyslipidemia warranted possible pharmacologic treatment (low-density lipoprotein > or =160 mg/dL). Of the 28.6\% who did not have a positive family history (did not meet NCEP guidelines), 548 (9.5\%) had dyslipidemia, 1.7\% of whom warranted pharmacologic treatment. Sensitivity and specificity data demonstrated that family history does not provide a strong indication as to whether pharmacologic treatment may be warranted. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the use of family history to determine the need for cholesterol screening in children would have (1) missed many with moderate dyslipidemia and (2) failed to detect a substantial number with likely genetic dyslipidemias that would require pharmacologic treatment. The use of universal cholesterol screening would identify all children with severe dyslipidemia, allowing for proper intervention and follow-up and leading to the prevention of future atherosclerotic disease.},

abstract = {Structure-based virtual screening today is basically organized as a sequential process where the molecules of a screening library are evaluated for instance with respect to their fit with a biological target. In this paper, we present a novel structure-based screening paradigm avoiding sequential searching and therefore enabling sublinear runtime behavior. We implemented the novel paradigm in the virtual screening tool TrixX and successfully applied it in screening experiments on four targets from relevant therapeutic areas. With the screening paradigm implemented in TrixX, we propose some important extensions and modifications to traditional virtual screening approaches: Instead of processing all compounds in the screening library sequentially, TrixX first analyzes the geometric and physicochemical binding site characteristics and then draws compounds with matching features from a compound catalog. The catalog organizes the compounds by their physicochemical and geometric features making use of relational database technology with indexed tables in order to support efficient queries for compounds with specific features. A key element of the compound catalog is a highly selective geometric descriptor that carries information on the type of functional groups of the compound, their Euclidian distance, the preferred interaction direction of each functional group, and the location of steric bulk around the triangle. In a re-docking experiment with 200 protein-ligand complexes, we could show that TrixX is able to correctly predict the location of ligand functional groups in co-crystallized complexes. In a retrospective virtual screening experiment for four different targets, the enrichment factors of TrixX are comparable to the enrichment factors of FlexX and FlexX-Scan. With computing times clearly below one second per compound, TrixX counts among the fastest virtual screening tools currently available and is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than standard FlexX.},

abstract = {Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

In the 21st century, the problem no longer lies in writing the learner but in choosing which learners to run on a given data set. We argue that the final choice of learners should not be exclusive; in fact, there are distinct advantages in running data sets through multiple learners. To illustrate our point, we perform a case study on a reuse data set using three different styles of learners: association rule, decision tree induction, and treatment. Software reuse is a topic of avid debate in the professional and academic arena; it has proven that it can be both a blessing and a curse. Although there is much debate over where and when reuse should be instituted into a project, our learners found some procedures which should significantly improve the odds of a reuse program succeeding.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (cQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers and MSN QnA, facilitate knowledge sharing through question answering by an online community of users. These services include incentive mechanisms to entice participation and self-regulate the quality of the content contributed by the users. In order to encourage quality contributions, community members are asked to nominate the \&amp;\#x02018;best\&amp;\#x02019; among the answers provided to a question. The service then awards extra points to the author who provided the winning answer and to the voters who cast their vote for that answer. The best answers are typically selected by plurality voting, a scheme that is simple, yet vulnerable to random voting and collusion. We propose a weighted voting method that incorporates information about the voters\&amp;\#x02019; behavior. It assigns a score to each voter that captures the level of agreement with other voters. It uses the voter scores to aggregate the votes and determine the best answer. The mathematical formulation leads to the application of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem which guarantees the existence of a voter scoring function that satisfies the starting axiom. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through simulations and analysis of real cQA service data.},

abstract = {The behavior of nondeterminate systems can be hard to predict,
since similar inputs at different times can generate different outputs.
In other words, the behavior seen during the testing process may not be
seen at runtime. Due to the uncertainties associated with
nondeterminism, the standard view is that we should avoid such
nondeterminate systems, especially for systems requiring high
reliability. While this is a valid guideline, at least in two
application areas such nondeterminacy is unavoidable. Early life-cycle
requirements and AI software are becoming widely used, yet both are
imprecise and may exhibit nondeterminate behaviour if explored
rigorously by a test device. Based on a literature review and some
theoretical studies, we argue that many stable properties exist within
the space of all possible nondeterminate behaviors. However, we also
show that seemingly trivial changes to a nondeterministic system can
turn an easily testable system into an impossibly hard system to test.
Finally, we stress that this analysis does not imply a correlation
between stable zones of nondeterminate testability and the ultimate
maintainability of nondeterminate systems. That is, while we are
optimistic about testing nondeterminate systems, we remain cautious
about the maintenance of such systems},

abstract = {Knowledge-based engineering and computational intelligence are
expected to become core technologies in the design and manufacturing for
the next generation of space exploration missions. Yet, if one is
concerned with the reliability of knowledge based systems, studies
indicate significant disagreement regarding the amount of testing needed
for system assessment. The sizes of standard black-box test suites are
impracticably large since the black-box approach neglects the internal
structure of knowledge-based systems. On the contrary, practical results
repeatedly indicate that only a few tests are needed to sample the range
of behaviors of a knowledge-based program. In this paper, we model
testing as a search process over the internal state space of the
knowledge-based system. When comparing different test suites, the test
suite that examines larger portion of the state space is considered more
complete. Our goal is to investigate the trade-off between the
completeness criterion and the size of test suites. The results of
testing experiment on tens of thousands of mutants of real-world
knowledge based systems indicate that a very limited gain in
completeness can be achieved through prolonged testing. The use of
simple (or random) search strategies for testing appears to be as
powerful as testing by more thorough search algorithms},

NScore is an extremely simple function and has the minimum possible number of parameters; nevertheless, it allows all the main effects determining the ligand-protein interaction to be taken into account. The fundamental difference of NScore from the currently used empirical functions is that all its parameters are selected on the basis of general physical considerations, without any adjustment or training with the use of experimental data on ligand-protein interaction. The results of docking and scoring with the use of NScore in an independent test sets of proteins and ligands have proved to be as good as those yielded by the ICM, GOLD, and Glide software packages, which use sophisticated empirical scoring functions. With respect to some parameters, the results of docking with the use of NScore are even better than those obtained using other functions. Since no training set is used in the development of NScore, this scoring function is indeed versatile in that it does not depend on the specific goal or target. We have performed virtual screening for ten targets and obtained results almost as good as those yielded by the Glide and better than GOLD and DOCK software.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of analyzing market-basket data and present several important contributions. First, we present a new algorithm for nding large itemsets which uses fewer passes over the data than classic algorithms, and yet uses fewer candidate itemsets than methods based on sampling. We investigate the idea of item reordering, which can im- prove the low-level e ciency of the algorithm. Second, we present a new way of generating $\backslash$implication rules," which are normalized based on both the antecedent and the con- sequent and are truly implications (not simply a measure of co-occurrence), and we show how they produce more in- tuitive results than other methods. Finally, we show how di erent characteristics of real data, as opposed to synthetic data, can dramatically a ect the performance of the system and the form of the results.},

Our motivation is to get a feel for (i) the kind of intrinsic low dimensional structure that can be empirically verified, (ii) the extent to which a spatial partition can exploit such structure, and (iii) the implications for standard statistical tasks such as regression, vector quantization, and nearest neighbor search.},

@article{Schuffenhauer2006,
abstract = {Following the theoretical model by Hann et al. moderately complex structures are preferable lead compounds since they lead to specific binding events involving the complete ligand molecule. To make this concept usable in practice for library design, we studied several complexity measures on the biological activity of ligand molecules. We applied the historical IC50/EC50 summary data of 160 assays run at Novartis covering a diverse range of targets, among them kinases, proteases, GPCRs, and protein-protein interactions, and compared this to the background of "inactive" compounds which have been screened for 2 years but have never shown any activity in any primary screen. As complexity measures we used the number of structural features present in various molecular fingerprints and descriptors. We found generally that with increasing activity of the ligands, their average complexity also increased, and we could therefore establish a minimum number of structural features in each descriptor needed for biological activity. Especially well suited in this context were the Similog keys and circular substructure fingerprints. These are those descriptors, which also perform especially well in the identification of bioactive compounds by similarity search, suggesting that structural features encoded in these descriptors have a high relevance for bioactivity. Since the number of features correlates with the number of atoms present in the molecule, also the number of atoms serves as a reasonable complexity measure and larger molecules have, in general, higher activities. Due to the relationship between feature counts and densities on one hand and biological activity on the other, the size bias present in almost all similarity coefficients becomes especially important. Diversity selections using these coefficients can influence the overall complexity of the resulting set of molecules, which has an impact on the biological activity that they exhibit. Using sphere-exclusion based diversity selection methods, such as OptiSim together with the Tanimoto dissimilarity, the average feature count distribution of the resulting selections is shifted toward lower complexity than that of the original set, particularly when applying tight diversity constraints. This size bias reduces the fraction of molecules in the subsets having the complexity required for a high, submicromolar activity. None of the diversity selection methods studied, namely OptiSim, divisive K-means clustering, and self-organizing maps, yielded subsets covering the activity space of the IC50 summary data set better than subsets selected randomly.},

Even if this overview is mainly centered in chemoinformatics, applications in other areas (pharmaceutical and medical chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, chemical databases management, etc.) are also introduced. The approaches used to define and describe the concepts of molecular similarity and diversity in the context of chemoinformatics are discussed in the first part of this review. We introduce, in the second and third parts, the descriptions and analyses of different methods and techniques. Finally, current applications and problems are enumerated and discussed in the last part.},

abstract = {Building quality software is expensive and software quality assurance (QA) budgets are limited. Data miners can learn defect predictors from static code features which can be used to control QA resources; e.g. to focus on the parts of the code predicted to be more defective. Recent results show that better data mining technology is not leading to better defect predictors. We hypothesize that we have reached the limits of the standard learning goal of maximizing area under the curve (AUC) of the probability of false alarms and probability of detection AUC(pd, pf) ; i.e. the area under the curve of a probability of false alarm versus probability of detection. Accordingly, we explore changing the standard goal. Learners that maximize AUC(effort, pd) find the smallest set of modules that contain the most errors. WHICH is a meta-learner framework that can be quickly customized to different goals. When customized to AUC(effort, pd), WHICH out-performs all the data mining methods studied here. More importantly, measured in terms of this new goal, certain widely used learners perform much worse than simple manual methods. Hence, we advise against the indiscriminate use of learners. Learners must be chosen and customized to the goal at hand. With the right architecture (e.g. WHICH), tuning a learner to specific local business goals can be a simple task.},

abstract = {The structure of a software system has a major impact on its maintainability. To improve maintainability, software systems are usually organized into subsystems using the constructs of packages or modules. However, during software evolution the structure of the system undergoes continuous modifications, drifting away from its original design, often reducing its quality. In this paper we propose an approach for helping maintainers to improve the quality of software modularization. The proposed approach analyzes the (structural and semantic) relationships between classes in a package identifying chains of strongly related classes. The identified chains are used to define new packages with higher cohesion than the original package. The proposed approach has been empirical evaluated through a case study. The context of the study is represented by an open source system, JHotDraw, and two software systems developed by teams of students at the University of Salerno. The analysis of the results reveals that the proposed approach generates meaningful re-modularization of the studied systems, which can lead to higher quality.},

However unless done carefully, that testing process can significantly add to the cost of requirements analysis. We show that requirements expressed as topoi diagrams can be built and tested cheaply <sup>s</sup>ing our SP2 algorithm, the formal temporal properties of a large class of topoi can be proven very quickly, in time nearly linear in the number of nodes and edges in the diagram. There are two limitations to our approach. Firstly, topoi diagrams cannot express certain complex concepts such as iteration and sub-routine calls. Hence, our approach is more useful for requirements engineering than for traditional model checking domains. Secondly, our approach is better for exploring the temporal occurrence of properties than the temporal ordering of properties. Within these restrictions, we can express a useful range of concepts currently seen in requirements engineering, and a wide range of interesting temporal properties.},

abstract = {An effective, quantitative approach for estimating and managing software projectsHow many people do I need? When will the quality be good enough for commercial sale? Can this really be done in two weeks? Rather than relying on instinct, the authors of Software Measurement and Estimation offer a new, tested approach that includes the quantitative tools, data, and knowledge needed to make sound estimations.The text begins with the foundations of measurement, identifies the appropriate metrics, and then focuses on techniques and tools for estimating the effort needed to reach a given level of quality and performance for a software project. All the factors that impact estimations are thoroughly examined, giving you the tools needed to regularly adjust and improve your estimations to complete a project on time, within budget, and at an expected level of quality.This text includes several features that have proven to be successful in making the material accessible and easy to master:* Simple, straightforward style and logical presentation and organization enables you to build a solid foundation of theory and techniques to tackle complex estimations* Examples, provided throughout the text, illustrate how to use theory to solve real-world problems* Projects, included in each chapter, enable you to apply your newfound knowledge and skills* Techniques for effective communication of quantitative data help you convey your findings and recommendations to peers and managementSoftware Measurement and Estimation: A Practical Approach allows practicing software engineers and managers to better estimate, manage, and effectively communicate the plans and progress of their software projects. With its classroom-tested features, this is an excellent textbook for advanced undergraduate-level and graduate students in computer science and software engineering.An Instructor Support FTP site is available from the Wiley editorial department.},

abstract = {Several research in defect prediction focus on building models with available local data (i.e. within company predictors). To employ these models, a company should have a data repository, where project metrics and defect information from past projects are stored. However, few companies apply this practice. In a recent work, we have shown that cross company data can be used for building predictors with the cost of increased false alarms. Thus, we argued that the practical application of cross-company predictors is limited to mission critical projects and companies should starve for local data. In this paper, we show that nearest neighbor (NN) sampling of cross-company data removes the increased false alarm rates. We conclude that cross company defect predictors can be practical tools with NN sampling, yet local predictors are still the best and companies should keep starving for local data.

abstract = {Two essential aspects of virtual screening are considered: experimental design and performance metrics. In the design of any retrospective virtual screen, choices have to be made as to the purpose of the exercise. Is the goal to compare methods? Is the interest in a particular type of target or all targets? Are we simulating a ‘real-world’ setting, or teasing out distinguishing features of a method? What are the confidence limits for the results? What should be reported in a publication? In particular, what criteria should be used to decide between different performance metrics? Comparing the field of molecular modeling to other endeavors, such as medical statistics, criminology, or computer hardware evaluation indicates some clear directions. Taken together these suggest the modeling field has a long way to go to provide effective assessment of its approaches, either to itself or to a broader audience, but that there are no technical reasons why progress cannot be made.},

abstract = { COCONUT calibrates effort estimation models using an exhaustive search over the space of calibration parameters in a Cocomo I model. This technique is much simpler than other effort estimation method yet yields PRED levels comparable to those other methods. Also, it does so with less project data and fewer attributes (no scale factors). However, a comparison between COCONUT and other methods is complicated by differences in the experimental methods used for effort estimation. A review of those experimental methods concludes that software effort estimation models should be calibrated to local data using incremental holdout (not jack knife) studies, combined with randomization and hypothesis testing, repeated a statistically significant number of times.},

abstract = {Continuing his exploration of the organization of complexity and the science of design, this new edition of Herbert Simon's classic work on artificial intelligence adds a chapter that sorts out the current themes and tools - chaos, adaptive systems, genetic algorithms - for analyzing complexity and complex systems. There are updates throughout the book as well. These take into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action. The chapter "Economic Reality" has also been revised to reflect a change in emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and markets in economic systems.},

abstract = { This paper studies how details of a particular model can effect the efficacy of a search for detects. We find that if the test method is fixed, we can identity classes of software that are more or less testable. Using a combination of model mutators and machine learning, we find that we can isolate topological features that significantly change the effectiveness of a defect detection tool. More specifically, we show that for one defect detection tool (a stochastic search engine) applied to a certain representation (finite state machines), we can increase the average odds of finding a defect from 69\% to 91\%. The method used to change those odds is quite general and should apply to other defect detection tools being applied to other representations.},

abstract = {Concept location is a critical activity during software evolution as it produces the location where a change is to start in response to a modification request, such as, a bug report or a new feature request. Lexical-based concept location techniques rely on matching the text embedded in the source code to queries formulated by the developers. The efficiency of such techniques is strongly dependent on the ability of the developer to write good queries. We propose an approach to augment information retrieval (IR) based concept location via an explicit relevance feedback (RF) mechanism. RF is a two-part process in which the developer judges existing results returned by a search and the IR system uses this information to perform a new search, returning more relevant information to the user. A set of case studies performed on open source software systems reveals the impact of RF on IR based concept location.},

abstract = {Spectral clustering is based on the spectral relaxation of the normalized/ratio graph
cut criterion. While the spectral relaxation is known to be loose, it has been shown
recently that a non-linear eigenproblem yields a tight relaxation of the Cheeger
cut. In this paper, we extend this result considerably by providing a characterization
of all balanced graph cuts which allow for a tight relaxation. Although
the resulting optimization problems are non-convex and non-smooth, we provide
an efficient first-order scheme which scales to large graphs. Moreover, our approach
comes with the quality guarantee that given any partition as initialization
the algorithm either outputs a better partition or it stops immediately.},

abstract = {Clustering is the problem of identifying the distribution of patterns and intrinsic correlations in large data sets by partitioning the data points into similarity classes. This paper studies the problem of clustering binary data. This is the case for market basket datasets where the transactions contain items and for document datasets where the documents contain “bag of words”. The contribution of the paper is three-fold. First a general binary data clustering model is presented. The model treats the data and features equally, based on their symmetric association relations, and explicitly describes the data assignments as well as feature assignments. We character- ize several variations with different optimization procedures for the general model. Second, we also establish the connections between our clustering model with other existing clustering methods. Third, we also discuss the problem for determining the number of clusters for binary clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering model.},

abstract = {A method is presented to partition a given set of data entries embedded in Euclidean space by recursively bisecting clusters into smaller ones. The initial set is subdivided into two subsets whose centroids are farthest from each other, and the process is repeated recursively on each subset. An approximate algorithm is proposed to solve the original integer programming problem which is NP-hard. Experimental evidence shows that the clustering method often outperforms a standard spectral clustering method, albeit at a slightly higher computational cost. The paper also discusses improvements of the standard K-means algorithm. Specifically, the clustering quality resulting from the K-means technique can be significantly enhanced by using the proposed algorithm for its initialization.},

Difficult problems, similar to the verification problem addressed by model checking, have been shown to exhibit a phase transition, suggesting that an easy range of problem instances might be solved much faster and with much less memory using a new type of model checker based on partial, random search. Here we compare the performance of Lurch, our pro- totype random search model checker, to the popular tools SMV and SPIN. The tools’ performance is com- pared for a range of randomly generated models based on a simple tic-tac-toe game. Our results suggest that Lurch might be used in place of existing tools for sys- tems too large or too difficult to model small enough for conventional model checking.},

When combined with genomic libraries and using RNA-binding proteins as baits, Genomic SELEX used with high-throughput sequencing enables the discovery of genomic RNA aptamers and the identification of RNA-protein interaction networks. Here we describe how to construct and analyze genomic libraries, how to choose baits for selections, how to perform the selection procedure and finally how to analyze the enriched sequences derived from deep sequencing. As a control procedure, we recommend performing a " Neutral" SELEX experiment in parallel to the selection, omitting the selection step. This control experiment provides a background signal for comparison with the positively selected pool. We also recommend deep sequencing the initial library in order to facilitate the final in silico analysis of enrichment with respect to the initial levels. Counter selection procedures, using modified or inactive baits, allow strengthening the binding specificity of the winning selected sequences. © 2010.},

abstract = {Concept location is a critical activity during software evolution as it produces the location where a change is to start in response to a modification request, such as, a bug report or a new feature request. Lexical-based concept location techniques rely on matching the text embedded in the source code to queries formulated by the developers. The efficiency of such techniques is strongly dependent on the ability of the developer to write good queries. We propose an approach to augment information retrieval (IR) based concept location via an explicit relevance feedback (RF) mechanism. RF is a two-part process in which the developer judges existing results returned by a search and the IR system uses this information to perform a new search, returning more relevant information to the user. A set of case studies performed on open source software systems reveals the impact of RF on IR based concept location.},

abstract = {Mental models are bases to recognise phenomena and make plans to improve situations. They can be expressed in model builders' natural language. It is also necessary to examine mental models using a computer simulation. The Computer simulation requires expressions, which can be translated into computer codes. Therefore, model builders need to translate their model from their own natural language to simulation-friendly language, i.e. stock flow diagrams in System Dynamics. It is widely recognised that this translation is sometimes difficult not only for people who are beginners of System Dynamics but also for people who are experienced in the field. This paper discusses a possible translation procedure and shows an application of it. The proposed procedure is designed to use a subset of a natural language as an intermediate language. This idea is applicable regardless of variety of natural language.},

abstract = { Assessing software costs money and better assessment costs exponentially more money. Given finite budgets, assessment resources are typically skewed towards areas that are believed to be mission critical. This leaves blind spots: portions of the system that may contain defects which may be missed. Therefore, in addition to rigorously assessing mission critical areas, a parallel activity should sample the blind spots. This paper assesses defect detectors based on static code measures as a blind spot sampling method. In contrast to previous results, we find that such defect detectors yield results that are stable across many applications. Further, these detectors are inexpensive to use and can be tuned to the specifics of the current business situations.},

The observed relationships were compared with those predicted by Lawrence Putnam's Rayleigh curve model and Barry Boehm's COCOMO model. The results suggested that although the form of the basic empirical relationships were consistent with the cost models, the COCOMO model was a poor estimator of cost for the current data set and the data did not follow the Rayleigh curve suggested by Putnam. However, the results did suggest that it was possible to develop cost models tailored to a particular environment and to improve the precision of the models as they are used during the development cycle by including additional information such as the known effort for the early development phases. The paper finishes by discussing some of the problems involved in developing useful cost models.},

abstract = {Changes during software evolution and poor design decisions often lead to packages that are hard to understand and maintain, because they usually group together classes with unrelated responsibilities. One way to improve such packages is to decompose them into smaller, more cohesive packages. The difficulty lies in the fact that most definitions and interpretations of cohesion are rather vague and the multitude of measures proposed by researchers usually capture only one aspect of cohesion. We propose a new technique for automatic re-modularization of packages, which uses structural and semantic measures to decompose a package into smaller, more cohesive ones. The paper presents the new approach as well as an empirical study, which evaluates the decompositions proposed by the new technique. The results of the evaluation indicate that the decomposed packages have better cohesion without a deterioration of coupling and the re-modularizations proposed by the tool are also meaningful from a functional point of view.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: SELEX is an iterative process in which highly diverse synthetic nucleic acid libraries are selected over many rounds to finally identify aptamers with desired properties. However, little is understood as how binders are enriched during the selection course. Next-generation sequencing offers the opportunity to open the black box and observe a large part of the population dynamics during the selection process.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: We have performed a semi-automated SELEX procedure on the model target streptavidin starting with a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide library and compared results obtained by the conventional analysis via cloning and Sanger sequencing with next-generation sequencing. In order to follow the population dynamics during the selection, pools from all selection rounds were barcoded and sequenced in parallel.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: High affinity aptamers can be readily identified simply by copy number enrichment in the first selection rounds. Based on our results, we suggest a new selection scheme that avoids a high number of iterative selection rounds while reducing time, PCR bias, and artifacts.},

abstract = {Models for numerical simulations should be described in a coherent style. They are expected to have consistencies at the causal dependency level. However, System Dynamics causal loop diagrams can have inconsistencies. This diagram style’s arrows, concerning flow and stock relationships, can have the opposite direction of stock flow diagrams which can numerically simulate models. These inconsistencies can cause inappropriate qualitative simulations so that it is sometimes recommended to use stock flow diagrams instead of causal loop diagrams even for qualitative simulations. However, causal loop diagrams have merits in their use. Causal loop diagrams are intuitively easy to draw and read. If causal loop diagrams are given information about each variable’s dynamic property, they can be changed to stock flow diagrams and simulation models can be generated. This paper suggests how to use causal loop diagrams as a starting point in numerical simulation research.},

Electronic patient records and sensor networks for in-home patient monitoring are at the current forefront of new technologies. Paper-based patient records are being put in electronic format enabling patients to access their records via the Internet. Remote patient monitoring is becoming more feasible as specialized sensors can be placed inside homes. The combination of these technologies will improve the quality of health care by making it more personalized and reducing costs and medical errors. While there are benefits to technologies, associated privacy and security issues need to be analyzed to make these systems socially acceptable. In this paper we explore the privacy and security implications of these next-generation health care technologies. We describe existing methods for handling issues as well as discussing which issues need further consideration.},

abstract = {By generating a large diversity of molecules, the immune system selects antibodies that bind antigens. Sharing the same approach, combinatorial biotechnologies use a large library of compounds to screen for molecules of high affinity to a given target. Understanding the properties of the best binders in the pool aids the design of the library. In particular, how does the maximum affinity increase with the size of the library or repertoire? We consider two alternative models to examine the properties of extreme affinities. In the first model, affinities are distributed lognormally, while in the second, affinities are determined by the number of matches to a target sequence. The second model more explicitly models nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) and proteins such as antibodies. Using extreme value theory we show that the logarithm of the mean of the highest affinity in a combinatorial library grows linearly with the square root of the log of the library size. When there is an upper bound to affinity, this "absolute maximum" is also approached approximately linearly with root log library size, reaching the upper limit abruptly. The design of libraries may benefit from considering how this plateau is reached as the library size is increased. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Context: There are many methods that input static code features and output a predictor for faulty code modules. These data mining methods have hit a "performance ceiling"; i.e., some inherent upper bound on the amount of information offered by, say, static code features when identifying modules which contain faults. Objective: We seek an explanation for this ceiling effect. Perhaps static code features have "limited information content"; i.e. their information can be quickly and completely discovered by even simple learners. Method: An initial literature review documents the ceiling effect in other work. Next, using three sub-sampling techniques (under-, over-, and micro-sampling), we look for the lower useful bound on the number of training instances. Results: Using micro-sampling, we find that as few as 50 instances yield as much information as larger training sets. Conclusions: We have found much evidence for the limited information hypothesis. Further progress in learning defect predictors may not come from better algorithms. Rather, we need to be improving the information content of the training data, perhaps with case-based reasoning methods. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {One of the most common comprehension activities undertaken by developers is concept location in source code. In the context of software change, concept location means finding locations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modification request. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source code using textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. In this paper we propose a novel static concept location technique, which leverages both the textual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between source code elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code, which is clustered using the Border Flow algorithm, based on combining both structural and textual data. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using data on almost 200 changes from five software systems. The results indicate that the new approach outperforms the baseline and that improvements are still possible.},

abstract = {Aptamers that bind small molecules can serve as basic biosensing platforms. Evaluation of the binding constant between an aptamer and a small molecule helps to determine the effectiveness of the aptamer-based sensors. Binding constants are often measured by a series of experiments with varying ligand or aptamer concentrations. Such experiments are time-consuming, material nonprudent, and prone to low reproducibility. Here, we use laser tweezers to determine the dissociation constant for aptamer-ligand interactions at the single-molecule level from only one ligand concentration. Using an adenosine 5'-triphosphate disodium salt (ATP) binding aptamer as an example, we have observed that the mechanical stabilities of aptamers bound with ATP are higher than those without a ligand. Comparison of the change in free energy of unfolding ($\Delta$G(unfold)) between these two aptamers yields a $\Delta$G of 33 ± 4 kJ/mol for the binding. By applying a Hess-like cycle at room temperature, we obtained a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 2.0 ± 0.2 $\mu$M, a value consistent with the K(d) obtained from our equilibrated capillary electrophoresis (CE) (2.4 ± 0.4 $\mu$M) and close to that determined by affinity chromatography in the literature (6 ± 3 $\mu$M). We anticipate that our laser tweezers and CE methodologies may be used to more conveniently evaluate the binding between receptors and ligands and also serve as analytical tools for force-based biosensing.},

abstract = {McGraw and Wong (1992) described an appealing index of effect size, called CL, which measures the difference between two populations in terms of the probability that a score sampled at random from the first population will be greater than a score sampled at random from the second. McGraw and Wong introduced this "common language effect size statistic" for normal distributions and then proposed an approximate estimation for any continuous distribution. In addition, they generalized CL to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case.In the current paper a different generalization of CL, called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations ofCL are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.},

This paper describes an application of DE to the automatic clustering of large unlabeled data sets. In contrast to most of the existing clustering techniques, the proposed algorithm requires no prior knowledge of the data to be classified. Rather, it determines the optimal number of partitions of the data "on the run." Superiority of the new method is demonstrated by comparing it with two recently developed partitional clustering techniques and one popular hierarchical clustering algorithm. The partitional clustering algorithms are based on two powerful well-known optimization algorithms, namely the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization. An interesting real-world application of the proposed method to automatic segmentation of images is also reported.},

abstract = {A multiobjective optimization problem involves several conflicting objectives and has a set of Pareto optimal solutions. By evolving a population of solutions, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are able to approximate the Pareto optimal set in a single run. MOEAs have attracted a lot of research effort during the last 20 years, and they are still one of the hottest research areas in the field of evolutionary computation. This paper surveys the development of MOEAs primarily during the last eight years. It covers algorithmic frameworks such as decomposition-based MOEAs (MOEA/Ds), memetic MOEAs, coevolutionary MOEAs, selection and offspring reproduction operators, MOEAs with specific search methods, MOEAs for multimodal problems, constraint handling and MOEAs, computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), dynamic MOPs, noisy MOPs, combinatorial and discrete MOPs, benchmark problems, performance indicators, and applications. In addition, some future research issues are also presented. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Seo2013,
abstract = {Context Along with expert judgment, analogy-based estimation, and algorithmic methods (such as Function point analysis and COCOMO), Least Squares Regression (LSR) has been one of the most commonly studied software effort estimation methods. However, an effort estimation model using LSR, a single LSR model, is highly affected by the data distribution. Specifically, if the data set is scattered and the data do not sit closely on the single LSR model line (do not closely map to a linear structure) then the model usually shows poor performance. In order to overcome this drawback of the LSR model, a data partitioning-based approach can be considered as one of the solutions to alleviate the effect of data distribution. Even though clustering-based approaches have been introduced, they still have potential problems to provide accurate and stable effort estimates. Objective In this paper, we propose a new data partitioning-based approach to achieve more accurate and stable effort estimates via LSR. This approach also provides an effort prediction interval that is useful to describe the uncertainty of the estimates. Method Empirical experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by comparing with the basic LSR approach and clustering-based approaches, based on industrial data sets (two subsets of the ISBSG (Release 9) data set and one industrial data set collected from a banking institution). Results The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only improves the accuracy of effort estimation more significantly than that of other approaches, but it also achieves robust and stable results according to the degree of data partitioning. Conclusion Compared with the other considered approaches, the proposed approach shows a superior performance by alleviating the effect of data distribution that is a major practical issue in software effort estimation. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In recent years, some spectral feature selec- tion methods are proposed to choose those features with high power of preserving sam- ple similarity. However, when there exist lots of irrelevant or noisy features in data, the similarity matrix constructed from all the un-weighted features may be not reli- able, which then misleads existing spectral feature selection methods to select ’wrong’ features. To solve this problem, we pro- pose that feature importance should be eval- uated according to their impacts on similar- ity matrix, which means features with high impacts on similarity matrix should be cho- sen as important ones. Since graph Lapla- cian(Luxburg, 2007) is defined on the simi- larity matrix, then the impact of each feature on similarity matrix can be reflected on the change of graph Laplacian, especially on its eigen-system. Based on this point of view, we propose an Eigenvalue Sensitive Crite- ria (EVSC) for feature selection, which aims at seeking those features with high impact on graph Laplacian’s eigenvalues. Empirical analysis demonstrates our proposed method outperforms some traditional spectral feature selection methods. 1.},

abstract = {It is difficult to assess hypothetical models in poorly measured domains such as neuroendocrinology. Without a large library of observations to constrain inference, the execution of such incomplete models implies making assumptions. Mutually exclusive assumptions must be kept in separate worlds. We define a general abductive multiple-worlds engine that assesses such models by (i) generating the worlds and (ii) tests if these worlds contain known behaviour. World generation is constrained via the use of relevant envisionment. We describe QCM, a modeling language for compartmental models that can be processed by this inference engine. This tool has been used to find faults in theories published in international refereed journals; i.e. QCM can detect faults which are invisible to other methods. The generality and computational limits of this approach are discussed. In short, this approach is applicable to any representation that can be compiled into an and-or graph, provided the graphs are not too big or too intricate (fanout < 7).},

This puts limits on human learning ability and on the kinds of learning tasks humans can easily han- dle. In this paper, we consider the prob- lem of “boosting” human learners to extend the learning ability of human learners and achieve improved performance on tasks which individual humans find difficult. We consider classification (category learning) tasks, pro- pose a boosting algorithm for human learn- ers and give theoretical justifications. We conduct experiments using Amazon’s Me- chanical Turk on two synthetic datasets – a crosshair task with a nonlinear decision boundary and a gabor patch task with a lin- ear boundary but which is inaccessible to hu- man learners – and one real world dataset – the Opinion Spam detection task introduced in (Ott et al., 2011). Our results show that boosting human learners produces gains in accuracy and can overcome some fundamen- tal limitations of human learners.},

Menzies and Di Stefano apply a number of data mining tools to the data set. While, inmost cases, their results are in agreement with ours, in some cases they are not. Our first and main observation is that our interpretation of the data set is based not only on the data set itself but also on the knowledge gathered during the interviews with project members. The main problem with the data set is its size: 23 data points. Although this data set is the largest one available about reuse projects, it is too limited to base analysis only on data mining techniques; data mining is usually applied to data sets with thousands if not millions of data points.},

abstract = {Clustering in high-dimensional spaces is a difficult problem which is recurrent in many domains, for example in image analysis. The difficulty is due to the fact that high-dimensional data usually exist in different low-dimensional subspaces hidden in the original space. A family of Gaussian mixture models designed for high-dimensional data which combine the ideas of subspace clustering and parsimonious modeling are presented. These models give rise to a clustering method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm which is called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC). In order to correctly fit the data, HDDC estimates the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of each group. Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that HDDC outperforms existing methods for clustering high-dimensional data. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Effort estimation often requires generalizing from a small number of historical projects. Generalization from such limited experience is an inherently underconstrained problem. Hence, the learned effort models can exhibit large deviations that prevent standard statistical methods (e.g., t-tests) from distinguishing the performance of alternative effort-estimation methods. The COSEEKMO effort-modeling workbench applies a set of heuristic rejection rules to comparatively assess results from alternative models. Using these rules, and despite the presence of large deviations, COSEEKMO can rank alternative methods for generating effort models. Based on our experiments with COSEEKMO, we advise a new view on supposed "best practices" in model-based effort estimation: 1) Each such practice should be viewed as a candidate technique which may or may not be useful in a particular domain, and 2) tools like COSEEKMO should be used to help analysts explore and select the best method for a particular domain},

abstract = { Model-based software has become quite popular in recent years, making its way into a broad range of areas, including the aerospace industry. The models provide an easy graphical interface to develop systems, which can generate the sometimes tedious code that follows. While there are many tools available to assess standard procedural code, there are limits to the testing of model-based systems. A major problem with the models are that their internals often contain gray areas of unknown system behavior. These possible behaviors form what is known as a data cloud, which is an overwhelming range of possibilities of a system that can overload analysts (Menzies et al., 2003). With large data clouds, it is hard to demonstrate which particular decision leads to a particular outcome. Even if definite decisions can't be made, it is possible to reduce the variance of and condense the clouds (Menzies et al., 2003). This paper presents two case studies; one with a simple illustrative model and another with a more complex application. The TAR3 treatment learning tool summarizes the particular attribute ranges that selects for particular behaviors of interest, reducing the data clouds.},

abstract = {Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an important technology in combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology of developing high affinity target-binding molecules (aptamers) from highly complex nucleic acid ligand libraries. Schematically, the SELEX is a series of iterative rounds of operations where in each operational round ligands are incubated with the target (e.g., a purified protein), and target-binding ligands are extracted and amplified. In the recent development of biological study and drug discovery, by incubating ligand libraries with complex target mixtures (e.g., cell fragments), the SELEX experiments have been explored to simultaneously develop aptamers for targets embedded in target mixtures: the complex SELEX. While holding the considerable advantages of saving experimental resources, practicing the complex SELEX has often accompanied with unstable experimental performances. It is therefore important to understand the behaviors of the new application. In this paper, we develop stochastic computer model, and customized computational algorithm to numerically mimic the complex SELEX. We model the ligand selection through the probability of ligand binding to complex targets at the binding equilibrium, and efficiency of separating target-binders for amplification. The customized computational algorithm allows us to simulate real experiments that operate on huge ligand libraries. We evaluate the ligand evolution, and aptamer enrichment of complex SELEX under various experimental conditions by stochastic simulations, and theorize the simulated results. We argue that the stochastic effects, which were not previously captured in the studies of complex SELEX, may significantly affect the results of experiments. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Information systems portfolio management assumes that software will evolve to maintain alignment with operational needs, a goal that must be met through effective ongoing maintenance. Thus, a primary goal of software maintainers is to ensure that production code is updated without the introduction of defects. However, there is a dearth of research that examines the work product defects that occur as these applications evolve. The goal of this study is to characterize software evolution lifecycle work product defects and factors that may increase or reduce their occurrence. The study takes place within a global consulting organization conducting ongoing software maintenance for a Fortune 100 telecommunications firm by a project team assessed at Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3. This study reports on 961 work product reviews conducted across the evolution activities of the ISO/IEC 12207 Software Development Life Cycle Processes. After controlling for team and expertise differences, the study's major finding is that corrective evolution projects inject a greater number of work product defects than enhancive evolution projects. This result does not arise from the schedule compression often associated with corrective evolution. Rather, it is concluded that the increase in work product defects is associated with the increased complexity of analysis-stage problem diagnosis found in corrective evolution projects. The analysis is augmented by additional covariates including the number of work product reviewers, preparation time of reviewers, and size of the project.},

abstract = {Clustering high dimensional data has become a challenge in data mining due to the curse of dimensionality. To solve this problem, subspace clustering has been defined as an extension of traditional clustering that seeks to find clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions within a dataset. This paper presents a new subspace clustering algorithm that calculates the local feature weights automatically in an EM-based clustering process. In the algorithm, the features are locally weighted by using a new unsupervised weighting method, as a means to minimize a proposed clustering criterion that takes into account both the average intra-clusters compactness and the average inter-clusters separation for subspace clustering. For the purposes of capturing accurate subspace information, an additional outlier detection process is presented to identify the possible local outliers of subspace clusters, and is embedded between the E-step and M-step of the algorithm. The method has been evaluated in clustering real-world gene expression data and high dimensional artificial data with outliers, and the experimental results have shown its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Clustering is a data mining problem that has received significant
attention by the database community. Data set size, dimensionality and
sparsity have been identified as aspects that make clustering more
difficult. The article introduces a fast algorithm to cluster large
binary data sets where data points have high dimensionality and most of
their coordinates are zero. This is the case with basket data
transactions containing items, that can be represented as sparse binary
vectors with very high dimensionality. An experimental section shows
performance, advantages and limitations of the proposed approach},

One reason for this deficiency in estimating is probably the unfortunate wall of separation that seems to divide those analysts who do cost estimating from those analysts who do schedule estimating. Another appears to be a lack of understanding of the extent of the impact of schedule growth on cost growth.},

We present an algorithm that integrates an information-theory-based approach and a scoring-function-based approach for learning structures of Bayesian networks. Our algorithm also makes use of basic Bayesian network concepts like d-separation and condition independence. We show that the proposed algorithm is capable of handling networks with a large number of variables. We present the applicability of the proposed algorithm on four standard network data sets and also compare its performance and computational efficiency with other standard structure-learning methods. The experimental results show that our method can efficiently and accurately identify complex network structures from data.},

abstract = {Chung et al. have proposed a graphical model that captures the interdependencies between design alternatives in terms of synergy and trade-offs. This model can assist in identifying quality/risk trade-offs early in the lifecycle of software development, such as architectural design and testing process choices. The Chung et al. method is an analysis framework only: their technique does not include an execution or analysis module. This paper presents a simulation tool developed to analyze such a model, and techniques to facilitate decision making by reducing the space of options worth considering. Our techniques combine Monte Carlo simulations to generate options with a machine learner to determine which option yields the most/least favorable outcome. Experiments based on the above methodology were performed on two case studies, and the results showed that treatment learning successfully pinpointed the key attributes among uncertainties in our test domains.

facilitate traceability to stakeholders, to structure the requirements
process, and to provide richer modelling by incorporating multiple
conflicting descriptions. In the latter case, the need to reason with
inconsistent models introduces considerable extra complexity. We
describe an empirical study of the utility of multiple world reasoning
(using abduction) for domain modelling. In the study we used a range of
different models (ranging from correct to very incorrect), different
fanouts, different amounts of data available from the domain, and
different modelling primitives for representing time. In the experiments
there was no significant change in the expressive power of models that
incorporate multiple conflicting viewpoints. Whilst this does not negate
the advantages of viewpoints during requirements elicitation it does
suggest some limits to the utility of viewpoints during requirements
modelling},

abstract = {In recent years, many partitional clustering algorithms based on genetic algorithms (GA) have been proposed to tackle the problem of finding the optimal partition of a data set. Surprisingly, very few studies considered alternative stochastic search heuristics other than GAs or simulated annealing. Two promising algorithms for numerical optimization, which are hardly known outside the heuristic search field, are particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). In this study, we compared the performance of GAs with PSO and DE for a medoid evolution approach to clustering. Moreover, we compared these results with the nominal classification, k-means and random search (RS) as a lower bound. Our results show that DE is clearly and consistently superior compared to GAs and PSO for hard clustering problems, both in respect to precision as well as robustness (reproducibility) of the results. Only for trivial problems all algorithms can obtain comparable results. Apart from superior performance, DE is very easy to implement and requires hardly any parameter tuning compared to substantial tuning for GAs and PSOs. Our study shows that DE rather than GAs should receive primary attention in partitional cluster algorithms.},

abstract = {A rapid development in diverse areas of molecular biology and genetic engineering resulted in emergence of variety of tools. These tools are not only applicable to basic researches being carried out world over, but also exploited for precise detection of abnormal conditions in plants, animals and human body. Although a basic researcher is well versed with few techniques used by him/her in the laboratory, they may not be well acquainted with methodologies, which can be used to work out some of their own research problems.The picture is more blurred when the molecular diagnostic tools are to be used by physicians, scientists and technicians working in diagnostic laboratories in hospitals, industry and academic institutions. Since many of them are not trained in basics of these methods, they come across several gray areas in understanding of these tools. The accurate application of molecular diagnostic tools demands in depth understanding of the methodology for precise detection of the abnormal condition of living body.To meet the requirements of a good book on molecular diagnostics of students, physicians, scientists working in agricultural, veterinary, medical and pharmaceutical sciences, it needs to expose the reader lucidly to:Give basic science behind commonly used tools in diagnosticsExpose the readers to detailed applications of these tools andMake them aware the availability of such diagnostic toolsThe book will attract additional audience of pathologists, medical microbiologists, pharmaceutical sciences, agricultural scientists and veterinary doctors if the following topics are incorporated at appropriate places in Unit II or separately as a part of Unit-III in the book.Molecular diagnosis of diseases in agricultural cropsMolecular diagnosis of veterinary diseases.Molecular epidemiology, which helps to differentiate various epidemic strains and sources of disease outbreaks. Even in different units of the same hospital, the infections could be by different strains of the same species and the information becomes valuable for infection control strategies.Drug resistance is a growing problem for bacterial, fungal and parasitic microbes and the molecular biology tools can help to detect the drug resistance genes without the cultivation and in vitro sensitivity testing. Molecular diagnostics offers faster help in the selection of the proper antibiotic for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is a major problem of the in the developing world. The conventional culture and drug sensitivity testing of tuberculosis bacilli is laborious and time consuming, whereas molecular diagnosis offers rapid drug resistant gene detection even from direct clinical samples. The same approach for HIV, malaria and many more diseases needs to be considered.Molecular diagnostics in the detection of diseases during foetal life is an upcoming area in the foetal medicine in case of genetic abnormalities and infectious like TORCH complex etc.The book will be equally useful to students, scientists and professionals working in the field of molecular diagnostics.},

abstract = { In the development of high-assurance systems, formal modeling, analysis and verification techniques are playing an increasingly important role. In spite of significant advances, formal modeling and verification using model checking, still suffer from limited applicability. The main reason is the exponential runtime space growth exhibited, in the general case, by model checkers. We describe a less rigorous alternative to model checking. We propose an algorithm that automatically translates finite state machine models used by model checkers into a variation of AND-OR graphs. State space verification of AND-OR graphs does not suffer from state space explosion, but its exhaustive search is an NP complete problem. Hence, we demonstrate that random search of AND-OR graphs is a viable alternative to model checking, suitable for system debugging and fast analysis during system development. We support our conclusions through the studies of two models, Dekker's two process mutual exclusion algorithm and the Space Shuttle's liquid hydrogen subsystem.},

Firstly, report “relevant”$\backslash$nresults; e.g. this paper explores the effects of distributed development$\backslash$non software products. Second: “recheck” old results if new results call$\backslash$nthem into question. Many papers say distributed development can be$\backslash$nharmful to software quality. Previous work by Bird et al. allayed that$\backslash$nconcern but a recent paper by Posnett et al. suggests that the Bird$\backslash$nresult was biased by the kinds of files it explored. Hence, this paper$\backslash$nrechecks that result and finds significant differences in Microsoft$\backslash$nproducts (Office 2010) between software built by distributed or$\backslash$ncollocated teams. At first glance, this recheck calls into question the$\backslash$nwidespread practice of distributed development. Our third rule is to$\backslash$n“reflect” on results to avoid confusing practitioners with an arcane$\backslash$nmathematical analysis. For example, on reflection, we found that the$\backslash$neffect size of the differences seen in the collocated and distributed$\backslash$nsoftware was so small that it need not concern industrial practitioners.$\backslash$nOur conclusion is that at least for Microsoft products, distributed$\backslash$ndevelopment is not considered harmful.},

expected to become core technologies in the design and manufacturing for
the next generation of space exploration missions. Yet, if one is
concerned with the reliability of knowledge based systems, studies
indicate significant disagreement regarding the amount of testing needed
for system assessment. The sizes of standard black-box test suites are
impracticably large since the black-box approach neglects the internal
structure of knowledge-based systems. On the contrary, practical results
repeatedly indicate that only a few tests are needed to sample the range
of behaviors of a knowledge-based program. In this paper, we model
testing as a search process over the internal state space of the
knowledge-based system. When comparing different test suites, the test
suite that examines larger portion of the state space is considered more
complete. Our goal is to investigate the trade-off between the
completeness criterion and the size of test suites. The results of
testing experiment on tens of thousands of mutants of real-world
knowledge based systems indicate that a very limited gain in
completeness can be achieved through prolonged testing. The use of
simple (or random) search strategies for testing appears to be as
powerful as testing by more thorough search algorithms},

The variants in- clude On-line K-means, Scalable K-means, and Incremental K-means, a proposed variant introduced that finds higher quality solutions in less time. Higher quality of solutions are obtained with a mean-based initialization and incremen- tal learning. The speedup is achieved through a simplified set of sufficient statistics and operations with sparse matri- ces. A summary table of clusters is maintained on-line. The K-means variants are compared with respect to quality of results and speed. The proposed algorithms can be used to monitor transactions.},

abstract = {SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) is an experimental procedure that allows the extraction, from an initially random pool of DNA, of those oligomers with high affinity for a given DNA-binding protein. We address what is a suitable experimental and computational procedure to infer parameters of transcription factor-DNA interaction from SELEX experiments. To answer this, we use a biophysical model of transcription factor-DNA interactions to quantitatively model SELEX. We show that a standard procedure is unsuitable for obtaining accurate interaction parameters. However, we theoretically show that a modified experiment in which chemical potential is fixed through different rounds of the experiment allows robust generation of an appropriate dataset. Based on our quantitative model, we propose a novel bioinformatic method of data analysis for such a modified experiment and apply it to extract the interaction parameters for a mammalian transcription factor CTF/NFI. From a practical point of view, our method results in a significantly improved false positive/false negative trade-off, as compared to both the standard information theory based method and a widely used empirically formulated procedure.},

abstract = {Context: Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system. In order to improve estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based SDEE models (ML models) since 1990s. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Objective: This research aims to systematically analyze ML models from four aspects: type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context. Method: We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ML model published in the last two decades (1991-2010). Results: We have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research. After investigating these studies, we found that eight types of ML techniques have been employed in SDEE models. Overall speaking, the estimation accuracy of these ML models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non-ML models. Furthermore, different ML models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts. Conclusion: ML models are promising in the field of SDEE. However, the application of ML models in industry is still limited, so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ML models. To this end, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: The accurate prediction of where faults are likely to occur in code can help direct test effort, reduce costs and improve the quality of software. Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used and the modelling techniques applied, influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method:We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesise the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modelling techniques such as Na??ve Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology and performance comprehensively.},

abstract = { Model-based software has become quite popular in recent years, making its way into a broad range of areas, including the aerospace industry. The models provide an easy graphical interface to develop systems, which can generate the sometimes tedious code that follows. While there are many tools available to assess standard procedural code, there are limits to the testing of model-based systems. A major problem with the models are that their internals often contain gray areas of unknown system behavior. These possible behaviors form what is known as a data cloud, which is an overwhelming range of possibilities of a system that can overload analysts (Menzies et al., 2003). With large data clouds, it is hard to demonstrate which particular decision leads to a particular outcome. Even if definite decisions can't be made, it is possible to reduce the variance of and condense the clouds (Menzies et al., 2003). This paper presents two case studies; one with a simple illustrative model and another with a more complex application. The TAR3 treatment learning tool summarizes the particular attribute ranges that selects for particular behaviors of interest, reducing the data clouds.},

abstract = {This paper gives a survey of contrast set mining (CSM), emerging pattern mining (EPM), and subgroup

all these research areas aim at discovering patterns in the form of rules induced from labeled data,
they use different terminology and task definitions, claim to have different goals, claim to use different
rule learning heuristics, and use different means for selecting subsets of induced patterns.
This paper contributes a novel understanding of these subareas of data mining by presenting a unified
terminology, by explaining the apparent differences between the learning tasks as variants of
a unique supervised descriptive rule discovery task and by exploring the apparent differences between
the approaches. It also shows that various rule learning heuristics used in CSM, EPMand SD
algorithms all aim at optimizing a trade off between rule coverage and precision. The commonalities
(and differences) between the approaches are showcased on a selection of best known variants
of CSM, EPM and SD algorithms. The paper also provides a critical survey of existing supervised
descriptive rule discovery visualization methods.},

abstract = {Recent work with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has allowed for external access to five of JPL's real-world requirements models, anonymized to conceal proprietary information, but retaining their computational nature. Experimentation with these models, reported herein, demonstrates a dramatic speedup in the computations performed on them. These models have a well defined goal: select mitigations that retire risks which, in turn, increases the number of attainable requirements. Such a non-linear optimization is a well-studied problem. However identification of not only (a) the optimal solution(s) but also (b) the key factors leading to them is less well studied. Our technique, called KEYS, shows a rapid way of simultaneously identifying the solutions and their key factors. KEYS improves on prior work by several orders of magnitude. Prior experiments with simulated annealing or treatment learning took tens of minutes to hours to terminate. KEYS runs much faster than that; e.g for one model, KEYS ran 13,000 times faster than treatment learning (40 minutes versus 0.18 seconds). Processing these JPL models is a non-linear optimization problem: the fewest mitigations must be selected while achieving the most requirements. Non-linear optimization is a well studied problem. With this paper, we challenge other members of the PROMISE community to improve on our results with other techniques.},

However unless done carefully, that testing process can significantly add to the cost of requirements analysis. We show that requirements expressed as topoi diagrams can be built and tested cheaply <sup>s</sup>ing our SP2 algorithm, the formal temporal properties of a large class of topoi can be proven very quickly, in time nearly linear in the number of nodes and edges in the diagram. There are two limitations to our approach. Firstly, topoi diagrams cannot express certain complex concepts such as iteration and sub-routine calls. Hence, our approach is more useful for requirements engineering than for traditional model checking domains. Secondly, our approach is better for exploring the temporal occurrence of properties than the temporal ordering of properties. Within these restrictions, we can express a useful range of concepts currently seen in requirements engineering, and a wide range of interesting temporal properties.},

abstract = {Traditional clustering models based on distance similarity are not always effective in capturing correlation among data objects, while pattern-based clustering can do well in identifying correlation hidden among data objects. However, the state-of-the-art pattern-based clustering methods are inefficient and provide no metric to measure the clustering quality. This paper presents a new pattern-based subspace clustering method, which can tackle the problems mentioned above. Observing the analogy between mining frequent itemsets and discovering subspace clusters, we apply pattern tree - a structure used in frequent itemsets mining to determining the target subspaces by scanning the database once, which can be done efficiently in large datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a general clustering quality evaluation model to guide the identifying of meaningful clusters. The proposed new method enables the users to set flexibly proper quality-control parameters to meet different needs. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that our method outperforms the existing methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective
optimisation maintain a population of solutions from which individuals
are selected for reproduction. In this paper, we introduce a simpler
evolution scheme for multiobjective problems, called the Pareto archived
evolution strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest
possible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions
in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm is identified as being a (1+1)
evolution strategy, using local search from a population of one but
using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to
identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate
solution vectors. PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against
which more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in
some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or
competitive with population-based methods. The performance of the new
algorithm is compared with that of a MOEA based on the niched Pareto GA
on a real world application from the telecommunications field. In
addition, we include results from experiments carried out on a suite of
four test functions, to demonstrate the algorithm's general capability

abstract = {Background: There are too many design options for software effort estimators. How can we best explore them all? Aim: We seek aspects on general principles of effort estimation that can guide the design of effort estimators. Method: We identified the essential assumption of analogy-based effort estimation, i.e., the immediate neighbors of a project offer stable conclusions about that project. We test that assumption by generating a binary tree of clusters of effort data and comparing the variance of supertrees versus smaller subtrees. Results: For 10 data sets (from Coc81, Nasa93, Desharnais, Albrecht, ISBSG, and data from Turkish companies), we found: 1) The estimation variance of cluster subtrees is usually larger than that of cluster supertrees; 2) if analogy is restricted to the cluster trees with lower variance, then effort estimates have a significantly lower error (measured using MRE, AR, and Pred(25) with a Wilcoxon test, 95 percent confidence, compared to nearest neighbor methods that use neighborhoods of a fixed size). Conclusion: Estimation by analogy can be significantly improved by a dynamic selection of nearest neighbors, using only the project data from regions with small variance.},

abstract = {Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) is an experimental procedure that allows extraction, from an initially random pool of oligonucleotides, of the oligomers with a desired binding affinity for a given molecular target. The procedure can be used to infer the strongest binders for a given DNA or RNA binding protein, and the highest affinity binding sequences isolated through SELEX can have numerous research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Recently, important new modifications of the SELEX protocol have been proposed. In particular, a modification of the standard SELEX procedure allows generating a dataset from which protein-DNA interaction parameters can be determined with unprecedented accuracy. Another variant of SELEX allows investigating interactions of a protein with nucleic-acid fragments derived from the entire genome of an organism. We review here different SELEX-based methods, with particular emphasis on the experimental design and on the applications aimed at inferring protein-DNA interactions. In addition to the experimental issues, we also review relevant methods of data analysis, as well as theoretical modeling of SELEX. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Many statistical techniques have$\backslash$nbeen proposed but there is no consensus on the methodology to select$\backslash$nthe ``best model" for the specific project. In this paper, we introduce$\backslash$nand discuss the merits of cost curve analysis of fault prediction$\backslash$nmodels. Cost curves allow software quality engineers to introduce$\backslash$nproject-specific cost of module misclassification into model evaluation.$\backslash$nClassifying a software module as fault-prone implies the application$\backslash$nof some verification activities, thus adding to the development cost.$\backslash$nMisclassifying a module as fault free carries the risk of system$\backslash$nfailure, also associated with cost implications. Through the analysis$\backslash$nof sixteen projects from public repositories, we observe that software$\backslash$nquality does not necessarily benefit from the prediction of fault$\backslash$nprone components. The inclusion of misclassification cost in model$\backslash$nevaluation may indicate that even the ``best" models achieve performance$\backslash$nno better than trivial classification. Our results support a recommendation$\backslash$nfavoring the use of cost curves in practice with the hope they will$\backslash$nbecome a standard tool for software quality model performance evaluation.},

abstract = { We have been exploring LURCH, an approximate (not necessarily complete) alternative to traditional model checking based on a randomized search algorithm. Randomized algorithms like LURCH have been known to outperform their deterministic counterparts for search problems representing a wide range of applications. The cost of an approximate strategy is the potential for inaccuracy. If complete algorithms terminate, they find all the features they are searching for. On the other hand, by its very nature, randomized search can miss important features. Our experiments suggest that this inaccuracy problem is not too serious. In the case studies presented here and elsewhere, LURCHS random search usually found the correct results. Also, these case studies strongly suggest that LURCH can scale to much larger models than standard model checkers like NuSMV and SPIN. The two case studies presented in this paper are selected for their simplicity and their complexity. The simple problem of the dining philosophers has been widely studied. By making the dinner more crowded, we can compare the memory and runtimes of standard methods (SPIN) and LURCH. When hundreds of philosophers sit down to eat, both LURCH and SPIN can find the deadlock case. However, SPINS memory and runtime requirements can grow exponentially while LURCHS requirements stay quite low. Success with highly symmetric, automatically generated problems says little about the generality of a technique. Hence, our second example is far more complex: a real-world flight guidance system from Rockwell Collins. Compared to NuSMV, LURCH performed very well on this model. Our random search finds the vast majority of faults (close to 90\%); runs much faster (seconds and minutes as opposed to hours); and uses very little memory (single digits to 10s of megabytes as opposed to 10s to 100s of megabytes). The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We begin with a theoretical rationale for why random search methods like LURCH can be incomplete, yet still successful. Next, we note that for a class of problems, the complete search of standard model checkers can be overkill. LURCH is then briefly introduced and our two case studies are presented.},

For continuous measures, it is the effect size measure. For dichotomous measures, it is proportional to the logarithm of the odds of the sensitivity plus the logarithm of the odds of the specificity. The measure is easily computed for both kinds of outcomes. Properties of this measure are discussed, and examples are given.

abstract = {Effort estimation often requires generalizing from a small number of historical projects. Generalization from such limited experience is an inherently underconstrained problem. Hence, the learned effort models can exhibit large deviations that prevent standard statistical methods (e.g., t-tests) from distinguishing the performance of alternative effort-estimation methods. The COSEEKMO effort-modeling workbench applies a set of heuristic rejection rules to comparatively assess results from alternative models. Using these rules, and despite the presence of large deviations, COSEEKMO can rank alternative methods for generating effort models. Based on our experiments with COSEEKMO, we advise a new view on supposed "best practices" in model-based effort estimation: 1) Each such practice should be viewed as a candidate technique which may or may not be useful in a particular domain, and 2) tools like COSEEKMO should be used to help analysts explore and select the best method for a particular domain},

abstract = {Recently, a number of researchers have proposed spectral algorithms for learning models of dynam- ical systems—for example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Partially Observable Markov Decision Pro- cesses (POMDPs), and Transformed Predictive State Representations (TPSRs). These algorithms are attrac- tive since they are statistically consistent and not sub- ject to local optima. However, they are batch methods: they need to store their entire training data set in mem- ory at once and operate on it as a large matrix, and so they cannot scale to extremely large data sets (ei- ther many examples or many features per example). In turn, this restriction limits their ability to learn accurate models of complex systems. To overcome these lim- itations, we propose a new online spectral algorithm, which uses tricks such as incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and random projections to scale to much larger data sets and more complex systems than previous methods. We demonstrate the new method on an inertial measurement prediction task and a high- bandwidth video mapping task and we illustrate desir- able behaviors such as “closing the loop,” where the la- tent state representation changes suddenly as the learner recognizes that it has returned to a previously known place.

abstract = {Context: There are many methods that input static code features and output a predictor for faulty code modules. These data mining methods have hit a "performance ceiling"; i.e., some inherent upper bound on the amount of information offered by, say, static code features when identifying modules which contain faults. Objective: We seek an explanation for this ceiling effect. Perhaps static code features have "limited information content"; i.e. their information can be quickly and completely discovered by even simple learners. Method: An initial literature review documents the ceiling effect in other work. Next, using three sub-sampling techniques (under-, over-, and micro-sampling), we look for the lower useful bound on the number of training instances. Results: Using micro-sampling, we find that as few as 50 instances yield as much information as larger training sets. Conclusions: We have found much evidence for the limited information hypothesis. Further progress in learning defect predictors may not come from better algorithms. Rather, we need to be improving the information content of the training data, perhaps with case-based reasoning methods. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {The clinical use of information technology in the dental profession has increased substantially in the past 10 to 20 years. In most developing countries an insufficiency of medical and dental specialists has increased the mortality of patients suffering from various diseases. Employing technology, especially artificial intelligence technology, in medical and dental application could reduce cost, time, human expertise and medical error. This approach has the potential to revolutionise the dental public health scenario in developing countries. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer programs that are designed to provide expert support for health professionals. The applications in dental sciences vary from dental emergencies to differential diagnosis of orofacial pain, radiographic interpretations, analysis of facial growth in orthodontia to prosthetic dentistry. However, despite the recognised need for CDSS, the implementation of these systems has been limited and slow. This can be attributed to lack of formal evaluation of the systems, challenges in developing standard representations, cost and practitioner scepticism about the value and feasibility of CDSS. Increasing public awareness of safety and quality has accelerated the adoption of generic knowledge based CDSS. Information technology applications for dental practice continue to develop rapidly and will hopefully contribute to reduce the morbidity and mortality of oral and maxillofacial diseases and in turn impact patient care.},

abstract = { Biclustering is an important problem that arises in diverse applications, including analysis of gene expression and drug interaction data. The problem can be formalized in various ways through different interpretation of data and associated optimization functions. We focus on the problem of finding unusually dense patterns in binary (0-1) matrices. This formulation is appropriate for analyzing experimental datasets that come from not only binary quantization of gene expression data, but also more comprehensive datasets such as gene-feature matrices that include functions of coded proteins and motifs in the coding sequence. We formalize the notion of an "unusually" dense submatrix to evaluate the interestingness of a pattern in terms of statistical significance based on the assumption of a uniform memoryless source. We then simplify it to assess statistical significance of discovered patterns. Using statistical significance as an objective function, we formulate the problem as one of finding significant dense submatrices of a large sparse matrix. Adopting a simple iterative heuristic along with randomized initialization techniques, we derive fast algorithms for discovering binary biclusters. We conduct experiments on a binary gene-feature matrix and a quantized breast tumor gene expression matrix. Our experimental results show that the proposed method quickly discovers all interesting patterns in these datasets.},

abstract = {Agile and traditional plan-based approaches to software system development both agree that prioritizing requirements is an essential activity. They differ in basic strategy - when to prioritize, to what degree, and how to guide implementation. As with many software engineering methods, verifying the benefit of following a particular approach is a challenge. Industry and student/classroom based experimental studies are generally impractical to use for large numbers of controlled experiments and benefits are difficult to measure directly. We use simulation to validate the fundamental, yet typically intangible benefits of requirements prioritization strategies. Our simulation is directly based on detailed empirical studies of agile and plan-based requirements management studies. Our simulation shows, as many have claimed, that an agile strategy excels when requirements are highly volatile, whereas a plan-based strategy excels when requirements are stable, and that there exist mixed strategies that are better than either for typical development efforts.},

abstract = {In this study we present a review of the emerging field of meta-knowledge components as practised over the past decade among a variety of practitioners. We use the artificially-defined term `meta-knowledge' to encompass all those different but overlapping notions used by the Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering communities to represent reusable modelling frameworks: ontologies, problem-solving methods, experience factories and experience bases, patterns, to name a few. We then elaborate on how meta-knowledge is deployed in the context of system's design to improve its reliability by consistency checking, enhance its reuse potential, and manage its knowledge sharing. We speculate on its usefulness and explore technologies for supporting deployment of meta-knowledge. We argue that, despite the different approaches being followed in systems design by divergent communities, meta-knowledge is present in all cases, in a tacit or explicit form, and its utilisation depends on pragmatic aspects which we try to identify and critically review on criteria of effectiveness.},

abstract = { Model-based software has become quite popular in recent years, making its way into a broad range of areas, including the aerospace industry. The models provide an easy graphical interface to develop systems, which can generate the sometimes tedious code that follows. While there are many tools available to assess standard procedural code, there are limits to the testing of model-based systems. A major problem with the models are that their internals often contain gray areas of unknown system behavior. These possible behaviors form what is known as a data cloud, which is an overwhelming range of possibilities of a system that can overload analysts (Menzies et al., 2003). With large data clouds, it is hard to demonstrate which particular decision leads to a particular outcome. Even if definite decisions can't be made, it is possible to reduce the variance of and condense the clouds (Menzies et al., 2003). This paper presents two case studies; one with a simple illustrative model and another with a more complex application. The TAR3 treatment learning tool summarizes the particular attribute ranges that selects for particular behaviors of interest, reducing the data clouds.},

abstract = {Clustering, principal component analysis, clustering stability, gene expression Clustering is one of the most commonly used tools in the analysis of gene expression data. The usage in grouping genes is based on the premise that co-expression is a result of co-regulation. It is thus a preliminary step in extracting gene networks and inference of gene function. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning, i.e. no information on the class variable is assumed, and the objective is to find the "natural" groups in the data. However, most clustering algorithms generate a clustering even if the data has no inherent cluster structure, so external validation tools are required. The emergence of cluster structure depends on several choices: data representation and normalization, the choice of a similarity measure and clustering algorithm. In this chapter we extend the stability-based validation of cluster structure, and propose stability as a figure of merit that is useful for comparing clustering solutions, thus helping in making these choices. We use this framework to demonstrate the ability of principal component analysis (PCA) to extract features relavant to the cluster structure. We use stability as a tool for simultaneously choosing the number of principal components and the number of clusters.},

In this paper, following a brief introduction to the PSO algorithm, the chronology of its evolution is presented and all major PSO-based methods are comprehensively surveyed. Next, these methods are studied separately and their important factors and parameters are summarized in a comparative table. In addition, a new taxonomy of PSO-based methods is presented. It is the purpose of this paper is to present an overview of previous and present conditions of the PSO algorithm as well as its opportunities and challenges. Accordingly, the history, various methods, and taxonomy of this algorithm are discussed and its different applications together with an analysis of these applications are evaluated.},

In one case, two generations of reuse were as good or better than any other project change (but a third and fourth generation of reuse was not useful). In another case, applying reuse to a project was demonstrable worse than several other possible changes to a project. Our conclusion is that the general claims regarding the benefits of software reuse do not hold for specific projects. We argue that the merits of software reuse need to be evaluated in a project by project basis. AI search over process models is useful for such an assessment, particularly when there is not sufficient data for precisely tuning a simulation model.},

abstract = {Genomic datasets often consist of large, binary, sparse data matrices. In such a dataset, one is often interested in finding contiguous blocks that (mostly) contain ones. This is a biclustering problem, and while many algorithms have been proposed to deal with gene expression data, only two algorithms have been proposed that specifically deal with binary matrices. None of the gene expression biclustering algorithms can handle the large number of zeros in sparse binary matrices. The two proposed binary algorithms failed to produce meaningful results. In this article, we present a new algorithm that is able to extract biclusters from sparse, binary datasets. A powerful feature is that biclusters with different numbers of rows and columns can be detected, varying from many rows to few columns and few rows to many columns. It allows the user to guide the search towards biclusters of specific dimensions. When applying our algorithm to an input matrix derived from TRANSFAC, we find transcription factors with distinctly dissimilar binding motifs, but a clear set of common targets that are significantly enriched for GO categories.},

abstract = {Instead of finding clusters in the full feature space, subspace clustering is an emergent task which aims at detecting clusters embedded in subspaces. Most of previous works in the literature are density-based approaches, where a cluster is regarded as a high-density region in a subspace. However, the identification of dense regions in previous works lacks of considering a critical problem, called "the density divergence problemrdquo in this paper, which refers to the phenomenon that the region densities vary in different subspace cardinalities. Without considering this problem, previous works utilize a density threshold to discover the dense regions in all subspaces, which incurs the serious loss of clustering accuracy (either recall or precision of the resulting clusters) in different subspace cardinalities. To tackle the density divergence problem, in this paper, we devise a novel subspace clustering model to discover the clusters based on the relative region densities in the subspaces, where the clusters are regarded as regions whose densities are relatively high as compared to the region densities in a subspace. Based on this idea, different density thresholds are adaptively determined to discover the clusters in different subspace cardinalities. Due to the infeasibility of applying previous techniques in this novel clustering model, we also devise an innovative algorithm, referred to as DENCOS (density conscious subspace clustering), to adopt a divide-and-conquer scheme to efficiently discover clusters satisfying different density thresholds in different subspace cardinalities. As validated by our extensive experiments on various data sets, DENCOS can discover the clusters in all subspaces with high quality, and the efficiency of DENCOS outperformes previous works.},

abstract = {A predictive model is required to be accurate and comprehensible in order to inspire confidence in a business setting. Both aspects have been assessed in a software effort estimation setting by previous studies. However, no univocal conclusion as to which technique is the most suited has been reached. This study addresses this issue by reporting on the results of a large scale benchmarking study. Different types of techniques are under consideration, including techniques inducing tree/rule based models like M5 and CART, linear models such as various types of linear regression, nonlinear models (MARS, multilayered perceptron neural networks, radial basis function networks, and least squares support vector machines), and estimation techniques that do not explicitly induce a model (e.g., a case-based reasoning approach). Furthermore, the aspect of feature subset selection by using a generic backward input selection wrapper is investigated. The results are subjected to rigorous statistical testing and indicate that ordinary least squares regression in combination with a logarithmic transformation performs best. Another key finding is that by selecting a subset of highly predictive attributes such as project size, development, and environment related attributes, typically a significant increase in estimation accuracy can be obtained.},

abstract = {Ensembles of learning machines are promising for$\backslash$nsoftware effort estimation (SEE), but need to be$\backslash$ntailored for this task to have their potential$\backslash$nexploited. A key issue when creating ensembles is to$\backslash$nproduce diverse and accurate base models. Depending on$\backslash$nhow differently different performance measures behave$\backslash$nfor SEE, they could be used as a natural way of$\backslash$ncreating SEE ensembles. We propose to view SEE model$\backslash$ncreation as a multiobjective learning problem. A$\backslash$nmultiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to$\backslash$nbetter understand the tradeoff among different$\backslash$nperformance measures by creating SEE models through the$\backslash$nsimultaneous optimisation of these measures. We show$\backslash$nthat the performance measures behave very differently,$\backslash$npresenting sometimes even opposite trends. They are$\backslash$nthen used as a source of diversity for creating SEE$\backslash$nensembles. A good tradeoff among different measures can$\backslash$nbe obtained by using an ensemble of MOEA solutions.$\backslash$nThis ensemble performs similarly or better than a model$\backslash$nthat does not consider these measures explicitly.$\backslash$nBesides, MOEA is also flexible, allowing emphasis of a$\backslash$nparticular measure if desired. In conclusion, MOEA can$\backslash$nbe used to better understand the relationship among$\backslash$nperformance measures and has shown to be very effective$\backslash$nin creating SEE models.},

@article{Iliuk2011,
abstract = {With over 2,000 publications, including about 250 reviews, resulting from a SciFinder search in just a two year period (2009-2010), the field of aptamer research has continuously generated lots of interest in the scientific community. Aptamers, first reported by three groups independently in 1990, are the artificial single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences (more recently, peptides) that fold into secondary and tertiary structures making them bind to certain targets with extremely high specificity. Owing to the high specific affinity of an aptamer to its target molecule (small molecules, proteins and even entire cells), it is thought to resemble chemical antibodies, with the dissociation constants ranging from nanomolar to picomolar level. Aptamers have a number of unique features which make them a more effective choice than antibodies. First, aptamers can be screened via in vitro process against a synthetic library, making it possible to target any molecules (from small inorganic ions to intact cells), overcoming the limit of having to use cell lines or animals, as is necessary for antibodies. Second, aptamers, once selected, can undergo subsequent amplification through polymerase chain reaction to produce a large quantity with high purity. Third, the simple chemical structure of aptamer makes it easily amendable to further modifications with functional groups according to different purposes. Finally, aptamers are much more stable than antibodies, making them suitable in applications requiring harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature or extreme pH).The applications of aptamers remain very dynamic, with increasing explorations in the fields of biosensing, diagnostics and therapeutics. There have been a numbers of excellent reviews in recent years with different emphases.4-8 Herein, as the first review of aptamers on Analytical Chemistry, we attempt to cover major progresses in bioanalytical applications of aptamers in the past 2 years.},

abstract = {Formal analysis of software is a powerful analysis tool, but can be too costly. Random search of formal models can reduce that cost, but is theoretically incomplete. However, random search of finite-state machines exhibits an early saturation effect, i.e., random search quickly yields all that can be found, even after a much longer search. Hence, we avoid the theoretical problem of incompleteness, provided that testing continues until after the saturation point. Such a random search is rapid, consumes little memory, is simple to implement, and can handle very large formal models (in one experiment shown here, over 10<sup>178</sup> states).},

abstract = {This paper introduces concepts and algorithms of feature selection, surveys existing feature selection algorithms for classification and clustering, groups and compares different algorithms with a categorizing framework based on search strategies, evaluation criteria, and data mining tasks, reveals unattempted combinations, and provides guidelines in selecting feature selection algorithms. With the categorizing framework, we continue our efforts toward building an integrated system for intelligent feature selection. A unifying platform is proposed as an intermediate step. An illustrative example is presented to show how existing feature selection algorithms can be integrated into a meta algorithm that can take advantage of individual algorithms. An added advantage of doing so is to help a user employ a suitable algorithm without knowing details of each algorithm. Some real-world applications are included to demonstrate the use of feature selection in data mining. We conclude this work by identifying trends and challenges of feature selection research and development.},

abstract = {Using process simulation and AI search methods, we compare software reuse against other possible changes to a project. such as reducing functionality or improving the skills of the programmer population. In one case, two generations of reuse were as good or better than any other project change (but a third and fourth generation of reuse was not useful). In another case, applying reuse to a project was demonstrable worse than several other possible changes to a project. Our conclusion is that the general claims regarding the benefits of software reuse do not hold for specific projects.

Youll learn to use time-saving features like list comprehensions and splats, organize your code into modules with extensible classes, and see how to deploy your work to multiple environments. Each chapter is example-driven and includes challenging exercises to push your CoffeeScript know-how further. Through the course of the book, youll build a fast-paced multiplayer word game writing both the client (with jQuery) and server (with Node.js) in CoffeeScript. And because the two languages are so deeply intertwined, youll deepen your understanding of JavaScript along the way. CoffeeScript makes it easier than ever to write powerful, standards-compliant JavaScript code. This book lets you start doing it today.},

@article{Athitsos2008,
abstract = {This paper describes BoostMap, a method for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval under computationally expensive distance measures. Database and query objects are embedded into a vector space, in which distances can be measured efficiently. Each embedding is treated as a classifier that predicts for any three objects X, A, B whether X is closer to A or to B. It is shown that a linear combination of such embeddingbased classifiers naturally corresponds to an embedding and a distance measure. Based on this property, the BoostMap method reduces the problem of embedding construction to the classical boosting problem of combining many weak classifiers into an optimized strong classifier. The classification accuracy of the resulting strong classifier is a direct measure of the amount of nearest neighbor structure preserved by the embedding. An important property of BoostMap is that the embedding optimization criterion is equally valid in both metric and non-metric spaces. Performance is evaluated in databases of hand images, handwritten digits, and time series. In all cases, BoostMap significantly improves retrieval efficiency with small losses in accuracy compared to brute-force search. Moreover, BoostMap significantly outperforms existing nearest neighbor retrieval methods, such as Lipschitz embeddings, FastMap, and VP-trees.},

abstract = {In mission critical systems, such as those developed by NASA, it is very important that the test engineers properly recognize the severity of each issue they identify during testing. Proper severity assessment is essential for appropriate resource allocation and planning for fixing activities and additional testing. Severity assessment is strongly influenced by the experience of the test engineers and by the time they spend on each issue. The paper presents a new and automated method named SEVERIS (severity issue assessment), which assists the test engineer in assigning severity levels to defect reports. SEVERIS is based on standard text mining and machine learning techniques applied to existing sets of defect reports. A case study on using SEVERIS with data from NASApsilas Project and Issue Tracking System (PITS) is presented in the paper. The case study results indicate that SEVERIS is a good predictor for issue severity levels, while it is easy to use and efficient.},

abstract = {Most process models calibrate their internal settings using historical data. Collecting this data is expensive, tedious, and often an incomplete process. Is it possible to make accurate software process estimates without historical data? Suppose much of uncertainty in a model comes from a small subset of the model variables. If so, then after (a) ranking variables by their ability to constrain the output; and (b) applying a small number of the top-ranked variables; then it should be possible to (c) make stable predictions in the constrained space. To test that hypothesis, we combined a simulated annealer (to generate random solutions) with a variable ranker. The results where quite dramatic: in one of the studies in this paper, we found process options that reduced the median and variance of the effort estimates by a factor of 20. In ten case studies, we show that the estimates generated in this manner are usually similar to those produced by standard local calibration. Our conclusion is that while it is always preferable to tune models to local data, it is possible to learn process control options without that data. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = { One of the goals of verification and validation (V\&amp;V) activities for online adaptive control systems is providing assurance that they are able to detect novel system behaviors and provide adequate (safe) control actions. Novel (or abnormal) system behaviors cannot be enumerated or fully and explicitly described in requirements documentation. Therefore, they have to be observed and recognized during the operation. Novelty detection methods, therefore, provide an adequate approach for the V\&amp;V purposes. We propose a novelty detection method based on support sector data description (SVDD) as a candidate approach for validating adaptive control systems. As a one-class classifier, the support vector data description is able to form a decision boundary around the learned data domain with very little or no knowledge of data points outside the boundary (outliers). We apply the SVDD techniques for novelty detection as part of the validation on an intelligent flight control system (IFCS). Experimental results show that the SVDD can be adopted as an effective tool for finding indications of the safe region for the learned domain, whereby we are able to separate faulty behavior from normal events.},

abstract = {During the past decade, solving constrained opti- mization problems with evolutionary algorithms has received considerable attention among researchers and practitioners. Cai and Wang’s method (abbreviated as CW method) is a recent constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm proposed by the authors. However, its main shortcoming is that a trial-and- error process has to be used to choose suitable parameters. To overcome the above shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved version of the CW method, called CMODE, which combines multiobjective optimization with differential evolu- tion to deal with constrained optimization problems. Like its predecessor CW, the comparison of individuals in CMODE is also based on multiobjective optimization. In CMODE, however, differential evolution serves as the search engine. In addition, a novel infeasible solution replacement mechanism based on multiobjective optimization is proposed, with the purpose of guiding the population toward promising solutions and the feasible region simultaneously. The performance of CMODE is evaluated on 24 benchmark test functions. It is shown empirically that CMODE is capable of producing highly competitive results compared with some other state-of-the-art approaches in the community of constrained evolutionary optimization},

In theory, software prediction models can be used to make that case. In practice, this is complicated by the "local tuning" problem. Normally, predictors for software effort and defects and threat use local data to tune their predictions. Such local tuning data is often unavailable. This paper shows that assessing the relative merits of different SE methods need not require precise local tunings. STAR1 is a simulated annealer plus a Bayesian post-processor that explores the space of possible local tunings within software prediction models. STAR1 ranks project decisions by their effects on effort and defects and threats. In experiments with two NASA systems, STAR1 found that ASE tools were necessary to minimize effort/ defect/ threats.},

abstract = {Aptamers are typically selected from libraries of random DNA (or RNA) sequences through systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), which involves several rounds of alternating steps of partitioning of candidate oligonucleotides and their PCR amplification. Here we describe a protocol for non-SELEX selection of aptamers--a process that involves repetitive steps of partitioning with no amplification between them. Non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM), which is a highly efficient affinity method, is used for partitioning. NECEEM also facilitates monitoring of bulk affinity of enriched libraries at every step of partitioning and screening of individual clones for their affinity to the target. NECEEM allows all clones to be screened prior to sequencing, so that only clones with suitable binding parameters are sequenced. The entire protocol can be completed in 1 wk, whereas conventional SELEX protocols take several weeks even in a specialized industrial facility.},

abstract = {Python Algorithms explains the Python approach to algorithm analysis and design. Written by Magnus Lie Hetland, author of Beginning Python, this book is sharply focused on classical algorithms, but it also gives a solid understanding of fundamental algorithmic problem-solving techniques. The book deals with some of the most important and challenging areas of programming and computer science, but in a highly pedagogic and readable manner. The book covers both algorithmic theory and programming practice, demonstrating how theory is reflected in real Python programs. Well-known algorithms and data structures that are built into the Python language are explained, and the user is shown how to implement and evaluate others himself. What you’ll learn Transform new problems to well-known algorithmic problems with efficient solutions, or show that the problems belong to classes of problems thought not to be efficiently solvable. Analyze algorithms and Python programs both using mathematical tools and basic experiments and benchmarks. Prove correctness, optimality, or bounds on approximation error for Python programs and their underlying algorithms. Understand several classical algorithms and data structures in depth, and be able to implement these efficiently in Python. Design and implement new algorithms for new problems, using time-tested design principles and techniques. Speed up implementations, using a plethora of tools for high-performance computing in Python. Who this book is for The book is intended for Python programmers who need to learn about algorithmic problem-solving, or who need a refresher. Students of computer science, or similar programming-related topics, such as bioinformatics, may also find the book to be quite useful.

@article{Levine2007,
abstract = {Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a procedure by which a mixture of nucleic acids that vary in sequence can be separated into pure components with the goal of isolating those with specific biochemical activities. The basic idea is to combine the mixture with a specific target molecule and then separate the target-NA complex from the resulting reaction. The target-NA complex is then separated by mechanical means (for example by filtration), the NA is then eluted from the complex, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the process repeated. After several rounds, one should be left with a pool of [NA] that consists mostly of the species in the original pool that best binds to the target. In Irvine et al. [Irvine, D., Tuerk, C., Gold, L., 1991. SELEXION, systematic evolution of nucleic acids by exponential enrichment with integrated optimization by non-linear analysis. J. Mol. Biol. 222, 739-761] a mathematical analysis of this process was given. In this paper we revisit Irvine et al. [Ibid]. By rewriting the equations for the SELEX process, we considerably reduce the labor of computing the round to round distribution of nucleic acid fractions. We also establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the SELEX process to converge to a pool consisting solely of the best binding nucleic acid to a fixed target in a manner that maximizes the percentage of bound target. The assumption is that there is a single nucleic acid binding site on the target that permits occupation by not more than one nucleic acid. We analyze the case for which there is no background loss (no support losses and no free [NA] left on the support). We then examine the case in which such there are such losses. The significance of the analysis is that it suggests an experimental approach for the SELEX process as defined in Irvine et al. [Ibid] to converge to a pool consisting of a single best binding nucleic acid without recourse to any a priori information about the nature of the binding constants or the distribution of the individual nucleic acid fragments. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: The NASA metrics data program (MDP) data sets have been heavily used in software defect prediction research. Aim: To highlight the data quality issues present in these data sets, and the problems that can arise when they are used in a binary classification context. Method: A thorough exploration of all 13 original NASA data sets, followed by various experiments demonstrating the potential impact of duplicate data points when data mining. Conclusions: Firstly researchers need to analyse the data that forms the basis of their findings in the context of how it will be used. Secondly, the bulk of defect prediction experiments based on the NASA MDP data sets may have led to erroneous findings. This is mainly because of repeated/duplicate data points potentially causing substantial amounts of training and testing data to be identical.},

abstract = {Software fault prediction models play an important role in software quality assurance. They identify software subsystems (modules,components, classes, or files) which are likely to contain faults. These subsystems, in turn, receive additional resources for verification and validation activities. Fault prediction models are binary classifiers typically developed using one of the supervised learning techniques from either a subset of the fault data from the current project or from a similar past project. In practice, it is critical that such models provide a reliable prediction performance on the data not used in training. Variance is an important reliability indicator of software fault prediction models. However, variance is often ignored or barely mentioned in many published studies. In this paper, through the analysis of twelve data sets from a public software engineering repository from the perspective of variance, we explore the following five questions regarding fault prediction models: (1) Do different types ofclassification performance measures exhibit different variance? (2) Does the size of the data set imply a more (or less) accurate prediction performance? (3) Does the size of training subset impact model's stability? (4) Do different classifiers consistently exhibit different performance in terms of model's variance? (5) Are there differences between variance from 1000 runs and 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation experiments? Our results indicate that variance is a very important factor in understanding fault prediction models and we recommend the best practice for reporting variance in empirical software engineering studies.},

abstract = {Genomic datasets often consist of large, binary, sparse data matrices. In such a dataset, one is often interested in finding contiguous blocks that (mostly) contain ones. This is a biclustering problem, and while many algorithms have been proposed to deal with gene expression data, only two algorithms have been proposed that specifically deal with binary matrices. None of the gene expression biclustering algorithms can handle the large number of zeros in sparse binary matrices. The two proposed binary algorithms failed to produce meaningful results. In this article, we present a new algorithm that is able to extract biclusters from sparse, binary datasets. A powerful feature is that biclusters with different numbers of rows and columns can be detected, varying from many rows to few columns and few rows to many columns. It allows the user to guide the search towards biclusters of specific dimensions. When applying our algorithm to an input matrix derived from TRANSFAC, we find transcription factors with distinctly dissimilar binding motifs, but a clear set of common targets that are significantly enriched for GO categories.},

abstract = {The fields of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.},

The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. We argue in this position paper that data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, information retrieval, data integration, etc., are necessary solutions to deal with software data. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created.
In order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners. Software engineering researchers can get inspired by other fields, such as, bioinformatics, where results of mining and analyzing biological data are often stored in databases shared across the world.},

abstract = {In recent years, various heuristic optimization methods have been developed. Many of these methods are inspired by swarm behaviors in nature. In this paper, a new optimization algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions is introduced. In the proposed algorithm, the searcher agents are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The proposed method has been compared with some well-known heuristic search methods. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the proposed method in solving various nonlinear functions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {"Python is a simple, yet powerful programming language that bridges the gap between C and shell programming, and is thus ideally suited for `throw-away programming' and rapid prototyping. Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and Icon. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C. Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba, the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but as the examples are self-contained, the tutorial can be read off-line as well. For a description of standard objects and modules, see the Python Library Reference manual. The Python Reference Manual gives a more formal definition of the language."},

abstract = {Genetically engineered whole cells as biosensing systems in biosensors have been employed, in the past two decades, for the detection of a variety of analytes. In addition to being rapid, specific/selective, and sensitive, these whole-cell-based sensing systems provide information pertaining to the analyte bioavailability. This information is particularly important to study the effect of harmful/toxic chemicals on living systems. The whole cells used for designing and developing cell-based sensing systems can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic in nature. These intact prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells can be genetically engineered to recognize the analytes of interest and respond with the production of a measurable signal in a dose-dependent manner. Generally, prokaryotic bacterial whole-cell sensing systems are developed by introducing a plasmid construct with a reporter gene fused to a promoter, which is induced by a target analyte through a regulatory protein. Similarly, a receptor, which is activated by a target analyte, is coupled with a reporter gene for the development of genetically modified eukaryotic cell-based biosensing systems. The most commonly used reporter proteins in whole-cell biosensing include luminescent proteins, such as bacterial and firefly luciferases; green fluorescent protein along with its variants; and $\beta$-galactosidase. The analytes that can be detected using genetically manipulated whole-cell sensing systems range from general toxicants and cell stress factors to specific analytes, such as metals, metalloids, organic pollutants, sugars, drugs, and bacterial signaling molecules. In order to develop self-contained sensing devices based on recombinant whole-cell sensing systems, preservation, miniaturization, and portability are important issues that need to be addressed.},

abstract = { Model-based software has become quite popular in recent years, making its way into a broad range of areas, including the aerospace industry. The models provide an easy graphical interface to develop systems, which can generate the sometimes tedious code that follows. While there are many tools available to assess standard procedural code, there are limits to the testing of model-based systems. A major problem with the models are that their internals often contain gray areas of unknown system behavior. These possible behaviors form what is known as a data cloud, which is an overwhelming range of possibilities of a system that can overload analysts (Menzies et al., 2003). With large data clouds, it is hard to demonstrate which particular decision leads to a particular outcome. Even if definite decisions can't be made, it is possible to reduce the variance of and condense the clouds (Menzies et al., 2003). This paper presents two case studies; one with a simple illustrative model and another with a more complex application. The TAR3 treatment learning tool summarizes the particular attribute ranges that selects for particular behaviors of interest, reducing the data clouds.},

abstract = {Methods to measure the sequence diversity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA lack standards for use as assay calibrators and controls. Here we present a general and economical method for developing customizable DNA standards of known sequence diversity. Standards ranging from 1 to 25,000 sequences were generated by directional ligation of oligonucleotide "words" of standard length and GC content and then amplified by PCR. The sequence accuracy and diversity of the library were validated using AmpliCot analysis (DNA hybridization kinetics) and Illumina sequencing. The library has the following features: (i) pools containing tens of thousands of sequences can be generated from the ligation of relatively few commercially synthesized short oligonucleotides; (ii) each sequence differs from all others in the library at a minimum of three nucleotide positions, permitting discrimination between different sequences by either sequencing or hybridization; (iii) all sequences have identical length, GC content, and melting temperature; (iv) the identity of each standard can be verified by restriction digestion; and (v) once made, the ends of the library may be cleaved and replaced with sequences to match any PCR primer pair. These standards should greatly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of sequence diversity measurements. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Youll learn to use time-saving features like list comprehensions and splats, organize your code into modules with extensible classes, and see how to deploy your work to multiple environments. Each chapter is example-driven and includes challenging exercises to push your CoffeeScript know-how further. Through the course of the book, youll build a fast-paced multiplayer word game writing both the client (with jQuery) and server (with Node.js) in CoffeeScript. And because the two languages are so deeply intertwined, youll deepen your understanding of JavaScript along the way. CoffeeScript makes it easier than ever to write powerful, standards-compliant JavaScript code. This book lets you start doing it today.},

abstract = {Planning for the optimal attainment of requirements is an important early lifecycle activity. However, such planning is difficult when dealing with competing requirements, limited resources, and the incompleteness of information available at requirements time. A novel approach to requirements optimization is described. A requirements interaction model is executed to randomly sample the space of options. This produces a large amount of data, which is then condensed by a summarization tool. The result is a small list of critical decisions (i.e., those most influential in leading towards the desired optimum). This focuses human experts' attention on a relatively few decisions and makes them aware of major alternatives. This approach is iterative. Each iteration allows experts to select from among the major alternatives. In successive iterations the execution and summarization modules are run again, but each time further constrained by the decisions made in previous iteration. In the case study shown here, out of 99 yes/no decisions (approximately 10<sup>30</sup> possibilities), five iterations were sufficient to find and make the 30 key ones.},

abstract = {Many experiments require a fast and cost-effective method to monitor nucleic acid sequence diversity. Here we describe a method called diversity visualization by endonuclease (DiVE) that allows rapid visualization of sequence diversity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products based on DNA hybridization kinetics coupled with the activity of a single-strand specific nuclease. The assay involves only a limited number of steps and can be performed in less than 4 h, including the initial PCR. After PCR, the homoduplex double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is denatured and reannealed under stringent conditions. During the reannealing process, incubation with S1 nuclease removes single-stranded loops of formed heteroduplexes and the resulting digest is visualized on agarose gel. The sequence diversity is inversely proportional to the band intensities of S1 nuclease surviving dsDNA molecules of expected size. As an example, we employed DiVE to monitor the diversity of panning rounds from a single-framework, semisynthetic single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library. The results are in good agreement with the observed decrease in diversity in phage display panning rounds toward the selection of monoclonal scFv. We conclude that the DiVE assay allows rapid and cost-effective monitoring of diversities of various nucleotide libraries and proves to be particularly suitable for scaffold-based randomized libraries. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Electronic patient records and sensor networks for in-home patient monitoring are at the current forefront of new technologies. Paper-based patient records are being put in electronic format enabling patients to access their records via the Internet. Remote patient monitoring is becoming more feasible as specialized sensors can be placed inside homes. The combination of these technologies will improve the quality of health care by making it more personalized and reducing costs and medical errors. While there are benefits to technologies, associated privacy and security issues need to be analyzed to make these systems socially acceptable. In this paper we explore the privacy and security implications of these next-generation health care technologies. We describe existing methods for handling issues as well as discussing which issues need further consideration.},

abstract = {The nearest neighbor classifier is one of the most used and well-known techniques for performing recognition tasks. It has also demonstrated itself to be one of the most useful algorithms in data mining in spite of its simplicity. However, the nearest neighbor classifier suffers from several drawbacks such as high storage requirements, low efficiency in classification response, and low noise tolerance. These weaknesses have been the subject of study for many researchers and many solutions have been proposed. Among them, one of the most promising solutions consists of reducing the data used for establishing a classification rule (training data) by means of selecting relevant prototypes. Many prototype selection methods exist in the literature and the research in this area is still advancing. Different properties could be observed in the definition of them, but no formal categorization has been established yet. This paper provides a survey of the prototype selection methods proposed in the literature from a theoretical and empirical point of view. Considering a theoretical point of view, we propose a taxonomy based on the main characteristics presented in prototype selection and we analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Empirically, we conduct an experimental study involving different sizes of data sets for measuring their performance in terms of accuracy, reduction capabilities, and runtime. The results obtained by all the methods studied have been verified by nonparametric statistical tests. Several remarks, guidelines, and recommendations are made for the use of prototype selection for nearest neighbor classification.},

@article{Chen2007a,
abstract = {Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an in vitro combinatorial engineering approach to enrich aptamers from a library of nucleic acids ligands by iterative extraction and amplification of receptor-bound ligands. Aptamers are the selected nucleic acid ligands with high receptor-binding affinity. Typically, they are obtained in single-receptor SELEX experiments where the ligand library is incubated with receptor molecules of a single identity, e.g., a purified protein. For years, aptamers have been shown to be valuable for biomedical applications and research. To further explore the power of SELEX technology, the idea of complex SELEX was proposed to obtain multiple aptamers by incubating the ligand library with multiple species of receptors. However, the reports on complex SELEX have been few, possible due to the ignorance of the effects of experimental variables. To address this problem, computer simulations should be useful. A major task of simulating complex SELEX is to solve interdependent binding equilibrium equations for binding events among heterogeneous ligands and receptors. Although a detailed subpooling model was developed, that model could be useful to simulate complex SELEX against at most four species of receptors, because the demand of computer memory grew exponentially with the number of receptor species. Here we develop a novel, condensed subpooling model where ligands of similar characteristic affinity are first pooled together regardless of receptor-specificity, and then divided into partial subpools receptor-specifically. With this model, the need of computer memory grows only linearly with receptor number. In the simulation of SELEX against four receptors, our results are the same or very similar to earlier work. We have further simulated SELEX against 100 heterogeneous receptors. We suggest that our computation method can be applied to other research fields where binding events between heterogeneous ligands and receptors are involved. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Context: Business process modeling is an essential part of understanding and redesigning the activities that a typical enterprise uses to achieve its business goals. The quality of a business process model has a significant impact on the development of any enterprise and IT support for that process. Objective: Since the insights on what constitutes modeling quality are constantly evolving, it is unclear whether research on business process modeling quality already covers all major aspects of modeling quality. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the state of the art on business process modeling quality: What aspects of process modeling quality have been addressed until now and which gaps remain to be covered? Method: We performed a systematic literature review of peer reviewed articles as published between 2000 and August 2013 on business process modeling quality. To analyze the contributions of the papers we use the Formal Concept Analysis technique. Results: We found 72 studies addressing quality aspects of business process models. These studies were classified into different dimensions: addressed model quality type, research goal, research method, and type of research result. Our findings suggest that there is no generally accepted framework of model quality types. Most research focuses on empirical and pragmatic quality aspects, specifically with respect to improving the understandability or readability of models. Among the various research methods, experimentation is the most popular one. The results from published research most often take the form of intangible knowledge. Conclusion: We believe there is a lack of an encompassing and generally accepted definition of business process modeling quality. This evidences the need for the development of a broader quality framework capable of dealing with the different aspects of business process modeling quality. Different dimensions of business process quality and of the process of modeling still require further research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) is an experimental procedure that allows the extraction, from an initially random pool of DNA, of those oligomers with high affinity for a given DNA-binding protein. We address what is a suitable experimental and computational procedure to infer parameters of transcription factor-DNA interaction from SELEX experiments. To answer this, we use a biophysical model of transcription factor-DNA interactions to quantitatively model SELEX. We show that a standard procedure is unsuitable for obtaining accurate interaction parameters. However, we theoretically show that a modified experiment in which chemical potential is fixed through different rounds of the experiment allows robust generation of an appropriate dataset. Based on our quantitative model, we propose a novel bioinformatic method of data analysis for such a modified experiment and apply it to extract the interaction parameters for a mammalian transcription factor CTF/NFI. From a practical point of view, our method results in a significantly improved false positive/false negative trade-off, as compared to both the standard information theory based method and a widely used empirically formulated procedure.},

abstract = {When designing a business workflow, it is customary practice to create the control flow structure first and to ensure its correctness. Information about the flow of data is introduced subsequently into the workflow and its correctness is independently verified. Improper specification of data requirements of tasks and XOR splits can cause problems such as wrong branching at XOR splits and the failure of tasks to execute. Here we present a graph traversal algorithm called GTforDF for detecting data flow errors in both nested and unstructured workflows, and illustrate its operation on realistic examples. Two of these have interconnected loops and are free of control flow errors, and the third one is an unstructured loop-free workflow. Our approach extends and generalizes data flow verification methods that have been recently proposed. It also makes use of the concept of corresponding pairs lately introduced in control flow verification. It thus has the potential for development into a unified algorithmic procedure for the concurrent detection of control flow and data flow errors. The correctness of the algorithm has been proved theoretically. It has also been tested experimentally on many examples.},

abstract = {This paper augments Boehm-Turner's model of agile and plan-based software development augmented with an AI search algorithm. The AI search finds the key factors that predict for the success of agile or traditional plan-based software developments. According to our simulations and AI search algorithm: (1) in no case did agile methods perform worse than plan-based approaches; (2) in some cases, agile performed best. Hence, we recommend that the default development practice for organizations be an agile method. The simplicity of this style of analysis begs the question: why is so much time wasted on evidence-less debates on software process when a simple combination of simulation plus automatic search can mature the dialog much faster?},

abstract = {The Internet has provided IS researchers with the opportunity to conduct studies with extremely large sam- ples, frequently well over 10,000 observations. There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the p-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, p-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on p-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low p-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the p-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay. We believe that addressing the p-value problem will increase the credibility of large sample IS research as well as provide more insights for readers.},

abstract = {Data mining is the discovery of interesting, unexpected or valuable structures in large datasets. As such, it has two rather different aspects. One of these concerns large-scale, 'global' structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, 'local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary. This paper gives a lightning overview of data mining and its relation to statistics, with particular emphasis on tools for the detection of adverse drug reactions.},

@article{Ritchie2010,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of family history in identifying children with severe or genetic hyperlipidemias in a rural, predominantly white population. METHODS: A total of 20,266 fifth-grade children in West Virginia, from the Coronary Artery Risk Detection in Appalachian Communities (CARDIAC) Project, who completed a family history and fasting lipid profile were used in analyses. The relationship between hyperlipidemia and family history was determined, and the use of family history to predict the need for pharmacologic treatment among children with dyslipidemia was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 71.4\% of children met the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines for cholesterol screening on the basis of positive family history. Of those, 1204 (8.3\%) were considered to have dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein > or =130 mg/dL), and 1.2\% of these children with dyslipidemia warranted possible pharmacologic treatment (low-density lipoprotein > or =160 mg/dL). Of the 28.6\% who did not have a positive family history (did not meet NCEP guidelines), 548 (9.5\%) had dyslipidemia, 1.7\% of whom warranted pharmacologic treatment. Sensitivity and specificity data demonstrated that family history does not provide a strong indication as to whether pharmacologic treatment may be warranted. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the use of family history to determine the need for cholesterol screening in children would have (1) missed many with moderate dyslipidemia and (2) failed to detect a substantial number with likely genetic dyslipidemias that would require pharmacologic treatment. The use of universal cholesterol screening would identify all children with severe dyslipidemia, allowing for proper intervention and follow-up and leading to the prevention of future atherosclerotic disease.},

abstract = {This paper describes the calibration process$\backslash$nincorporated and summarizes the results obtained. The$\backslash$nEarly Design Model calibration is obtained by$\backslash$naggregating the calibrated Effort Multipliers of the$\backslash$nPost-Architecture Model as described in [USC-CSE1]. The$\backslash$nScale Factor calibration is the same in both the$\backslash$nmodels. The Applications Composition Model has not yet$\backslash$nbeen calibrated due to limitations in the availability$\backslash$nof project data. This paper describes our experience$\backslash$nand results of the first calibration of the$\backslash$nPostArchitecture model. The model determination process$\backslash$nbegan with an expert Delphi process to determine$\backslash$napriori values for the PostArchitecture model$\backslash$nparameters. A dataset of 83 projects was used in the$\backslash$nmultiple regression analysis. Projects with missing$\backslash$ndata or unexplainable anomalies were dropped. Model$\backslash$nparameters that exhibited high correlation were$\backslash$nconsolidated. Multiple regression analysis was used to$\backslash$nproduce coefficients. These coefficients were used to$\backslash$nadjust the previously assigned expertdetermined model$\backslash$nvalues. Stratification was used to improve model$\backslash$naccuracy. The resulting model produced estimates within$\backslash$n30\% of the actuals 52\% of the time for effort.$\backslash$nStratification by organization resulted in a model that$\backslash$nproduced estimates within 30\% of the actuals 64\% of the$\backslash$ntime for effort. It is therefore recommended that$\backslash$norganizations using the model calibrate it using their$\backslash$nown data. This increases model accuracy and produces a$\backslash$nlocal optimum estimate for similar type projects.$\backslash$nSection 2 of this paper describes the data used for$\backslash$ncalibration. Section 3 describes the calibration$\backslash$nprocedures, results, and future calibration strategy.},

abstract = {SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) is a procedure by which a mixture of nucleic acids can be fractionated with the goal of identifying those with specific biochemical activities. One combines the mixture with a specific target molecule and then separates the target-NA complex from the resulting reactions. The target-NA complex is separated from the unbound NA by mechanical means (such as by filtration), the NA is eluted from the complex, amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), and the process repeated. After several rounds, one should be left with the nucleic acids that best bind to the target. The problem was first formulated mathematically in Irvine et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 222:739-761, 1991). In Levine and Nilsen-Hamilton (Comput. Biol. Chem. 31:11-25, 2007), a mathematical analysis of the process was given. In Vant-Hull et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 278:579-597, 1998), multiple target SELEX was considered. It was assumed that each target has a single nucleic acid binding site that permits occupation by no more than one nucleic acid. Here, we revisit Vant-Hull et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 278:579-597, 1998) using the same assumptions. The iteration scheme is shown to be convergent and a simplified algorithm is given. Our interest here is in the behavior of the multiple target SELEX process as a discrete "time" dynamical system. Our goal is to characterize the limiting states and their dependence on the initial distribution of nucleic acid and target fraction components. (In multiple target SELEX, we vary the target component fractions, but not their concentrations, as fixed and the initial pool of nucleic acids as a variable starting condition). Given N nucleic acids and a target consisting of M subtarget component species, there is an M × N matrix of affinities, the (i,j) entry corresponding to the affinity of the jth nucleic acid for the ith subtarget. We give a structure condition on this matrix that is equivalent to the following statement: For any initial pool of nucleic acids such that all N species are represented, the dynamical system defined by the multiple target SELEX process will converge to a unique subset of nucleic acids, each of whose concentrations depend only upon the total nucleic acid concentration, the initial fractional target distribution (both of which are assumed to be the same from round to round), and the overall limiting association constant. (The overall association constant is the equilibrium constant for the system of MN reactions when viewed as a composite single reaction). This condition is equivalent to the statement that every member of a certain family of chemical potentials at infinite target dilution can have at most one critical point. (The condition replaces the statement for single target SELEX that the dynamical system generated via the process always converges to a pool that contains only the nucleic acid that binds best to the target). This suggests that the effectiveness of multiple target SELEX as a separation procedure may not be as useful as single target SELEX unless the thermodynamic properties of these chemical potentials are well understood.},

abstract = {Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it. Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general-all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains: Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset Search engine features-crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in adataset Evolving intelligence for problem solving-how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful. Go beyond simple database-backed applications and put the wealth of Internet data to work for you. "Bravo! I cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods, nor can I think of a better way for me (an old AI dog) to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details." - Dan Russell, Google "Toby's book does a great job of breaking down the complex subject matter of machine-learning algorithms into practical, easy-to-understand examples that can be directly applied to analysis of social interaction across the Web today.

abstract = {There are more than twenty distinct software engineering tasks addressed with text retrieval (TR) techniques, such as, traceability link recovery, feature location, refactoring, reuse, etc. A common issue with all TR applications is that the results of the retrieval depend largely on the quality of the query. When a query performs poorly, it has to be reformulated and this is a difficult task for someone who had trouble writing a good query in the first place. We propose a recommender (called Refoqus) based on machine learning, which is trained with a sample of queries and relevant results. Then, for a given query, it automatically recommends a reformulation strategy that should improve its performance, based on the properties of the query. We evaluated Refoqus empirically against four baseline approaches that are used in natural language document retrieval. The data used for the evaluation corresponds to changes from five open source systems in Java and C++ and it is used in the context of TR-based concept location in source code. Refoqus outperformed the baselines and its recommendations lead to query performance improvement or preservation in 84\% of the cases (in average).},

abstract = {Since the suggestion of a computing procedure of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions in multi-objective optimization problems in the early Nineties, researchers have been on the look out for a procedure which is computationally fast and simultaneously capable of finding a well-converged and well-distributed set of solutions. Most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) developed in the past decade are either good for achieving a well-distributed solutions at the expense of a large computational effort or computationally fast at the expense of achieving a not-so-good distribution of solutions. For example, although the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm or SPEA (Zitzler and Thiele, 1999) produces a much better distribution compared to the elitist non-dominated sorting GA or NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002a), the computational time needed to run SPEA is much greater. In this paper, we evaluate a recently-proposed steady-state MOEA (Deb et al., 2003) which was developed based on the epsilon-dominance concept introduced earlier(Laumanns et al., 2002) and using efficient parent and archive update strategies for achieving a well-distributed and well-converged set of solutions quickly. Based on an extensive comparative study with four other state-of-the-art MOEAs on a number of two, three, and four objective test problems, it is observed that the steady-state MOEA is a good compromise in terms of convergence near to the Pareto-optimal front, diversity of solutions, and computational time. Moreover, the epsilon-MOEA is a step closer towards making MOEAs pragmatic, particularly allowing a decision-maker to control the achievable accuracy in the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions.},

We document a new NASA initiative to build a centralized repository of software defect data; in particular, we document one specific case study on software metrics. Software metrics are used as a basis for prediction of errors in code modules, but there are many different metrics available. McCabe is one of the more popular tools used to produce metrics, but, other metrics can be more significant.},

Automated selection procedures now allow rapid identification of DNA and RNA sequences that can target a broad range of extra- and intracellular proteins with nanomolar affinities and high specificities. The unique binding properties of nucleic acids, which are amenable to various modifications, make aptamers perfectly suitable for different areas of biotechnology. Moreover, the approval of an aptamer for vascular endothelial growth factor by the US Food and Drug Administration highlights the potential of aptamers for therapeutic applications. This review summarizes recent developments and demonstrates that aptamers are valuable tools for diagnostics, purification processes, target validation, drug discovery, and even therapeutic approaches.},

@article{Song2014,
abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly configurable. While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks,such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory,unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore,every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system's effective configuration space - the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal - could comprise only a tiny subset of the system's full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system's effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system's behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The - ey improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions - a construct that improves iTree's ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree's running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the \~{} 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.},

In this paper, we propose two recursive PCA algorithms for adaptive process monitoring. The paper starts with an efficient approach to updating the correlation matrix recursively. The algorithms, using rank-one modification and Lanczos tridiagonalization, are then proposed and their computational complexity is compared. The number of principal components and the confidence limits for process monitoring are also determined recursively. A complete adaptive monitoring algorithm that addresses the issues of missing values and outlines is presented. Finally, the proposed algorithms are applied to a rapid thermal annealing process in semiconductor processing for adaptive monitoring.},

abstract = {Model-checking techniques are successfully used in the verification of both hardware and software systems of industrial relevance. Unfortunately, the capability of current techniques is still limited and the effort required for verification can be prohibitive (if verification is possible at all). As a complement, fast, but incomplete, search tools may provide practical benefits not attainable with full verification tools, for example, reduced need for manual abstraction and fast detection of property violations during model development. In this report we investigate the performance of a simple random search technique. We conducted an experiment on a production-sized formal model of the mode-logic of a flight guidance system. Our results indicate that random search quickly finds the vast majority of property violations in our case-example. In addition, the times to detect various property violations follow an acutely right-skewed distribution and are highly biased toward the easy side. We hypothesize that the observations reported here are related to the phase transition phenomenon seen in Boolean satisfiability and other NP-complete problems. If so, these observations could be revealing some of the fundamental aspects of software (model) faults and have implications on how software engineering activities, such as analysis, testing, and reliability modeling, should be performed},

abstract = {Aptamers are oligonucleotides derived from an in vitro evolution process called SELEX. Aptamers have been evolved to bind proteins which are associated with a number of disease states. Using this method, many powerful antagonists of such proteins have been found. In order for these antagonists to work in animal models of disease and in humans, it is necessary to modify the aptamers. First of all, sugar modifications of nucleoside triphosphates are necessary to render the resulting aptamers resistant to nucleases found in serum. Changing the 2'OH groups of ribose to 2'F or 2'NH2 groups yields aptamers which are long lived in blood. The relatively low molecular weight of aptamers (8000-12000) leads to rapid clearance from the blood. Aptamers can be kept in the circulation from hours to days by conjugating them to higher molecular weight vehicles. When modified, conjugated aptamers are injected into animals, they inhibit physiological functions known to be associated with their target proteins. A new approach to diagnostics is also described. Aptamer arrays on solid surfaces will become available rapidly because the SELEX protocol has been successfully automated. The use of photo-cross-linkable aptamers will allow the covalent attachment of aptamers to their cognate proteins, with very low backgrounds from other proteins in body fluids. Finally, protein staining with any reagent which distinguishes functional groups of amino acids from those of nucleic acids (and the solid support) will give a direct readout of proteins on the solid support.},

Hence, it is not enough to just generate solutions to requirements problems- we must also assess solution robustness. The KEYS2 algorithm can generate decision ordering diagrams. Once generated, these diagrams can assess solution robustness in linear time. In experiments with real-world requirements engineering models, we show that KEYS2 can generate decision ordering diagrams in O(N             2). When assessed in terms of terms of (a) reducing inference times, (b) increasing solution quality, and (c) decreasing the variance of the generated solution, KEYS2 out-performs other search algorithms (simulated annealing, ASTAR, MaxWalkSat).},

abstract = {A chance encounter between members of a random repertoire and a molecular target is characteristic of different biological systems, including the immune and olfactory pathways as well as combinatorial libraries. In such systems, the affinity between the target and members of the repertoire is distributed with a probability function describing the propensity of obtaining a particular affinity value. We have previously proposed a phenomenological receptor affinity distribution (RAD) formalism, which describes this probability function based on simple statistical considerations. In the present analysis, we use published data from diverse experimental systems, including phage display libraries, immunoglobulins and enzymes, to test the RAD model and to compare it to other affinity distribution formalisms. The RAD model is found to provide the best description for binding data for over eight orders of magnitude on the affinity scale, and to account for a relationship between repertoire size and the maximal obtainable affinity within different repertoires. This approach points to a potential universality of the rules that govern affinity distributions in biology.},

abstract = {Data mining is the discovery of interesting, unexpected or valuable structures in large datasets. As such, it has two rather different aspects. One of these concerns large-scale, 'global' structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, 'local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary. This paper gives a lightning overview of data mining and its relation to statistics, with particular emphasis on tools for the detection of adverse drug reactions.},

@article{Hand2007b,
abstract = {Data mining is the discovery of interesting, unexpected or valuable structures in large datasets. As such, it has two rather different aspects. One of these concerns large-scale, 'global' structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, 'local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary. This paper gives a lightning overview of data mining and its relation to statistics, with particular emphasis on tools for the detection of adverse drug reactions.},

@article{Athitsos2008b,
abstract = {This paper describes BoostMap, a method for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval under computationally expensive distance measures. Database and query objects are embedded into a vector space, in which distances can be measured efficiently. Each embedding is treated as a classifier that predicts for any three objects X, A, B whether X is closer to A or to B. It is shown that a linear combination of such embeddingbased classifiers naturally corresponds to an embedding and a distance measure. Based on this property, the BoostMap method reduces the problem of embedding construction to the classical boosting problem of combining many weak classifiers into an optimized strong classifier. The classification accuracy of the resulting strong classifier is a direct measure of the amount of nearest neighbor structure preserved by the embedding. An important property of BoostMap is that the embedding optimization criterion is equally valid in both metric and non-metric spaces. Performance is evaluated in databases of hand images, handwritten digits, and time series. In all cases, BoostMap significantly improves retrieval efficiency with small losses in accuracy compared to brute-force search. Moreover, BoostMap significantly outperforms existing nearest neighbor retrieval methods, such as Lipschitz embeddings, FastMap, and VP-trees.},

abstract = {When designing a business workflow, it is customary practice to create the control flow structure first and to ensure its correctness. Information about the flow of data is introduced subsequently into the workflow and its correctness is independently verified. Improper specification of data requirements of tasks and XOR splits can cause problems such as wrong branching at XOR splits and the failure of tasks to execute. Here we present a graph traversal algorithm called GTforDF for detecting data flow errors in both nested and unstructured workflows, and illustrate its operation on realistic examples. Two of these have interconnected loops and are free of control flow errors, and the third one is an unstructured loop-free workflow. Our approach extends and generalizes data flow verification methods that have been recently proposed. It also makes use of the concept of corresponding pairs lately introduced in control flow verification. It thus has the potential for development into a unified algorithmic procedure for the concurrent detection of control flow and data flow errors. The correctness of the algorithm has been proved theoretically. It has also been tested experimentally on many examples.},

abstract = {Since most real-world applications of classification learning involve continuous-valued attributes, properly addressing the discretization process is an important problem. This paper addresses the use of the entropy minimization heuristic for discretizing the range of a continuous-valued attribute into multiple intervals. We briefly present theoretical evidence for the appropriateness of this heuristic for use in the binary discretization algorithm used in ID3, C4, CART, and other learning algorithms. The results serve to justify extending the algorithm to derive multiple intervals. We formally derive a criterion based on the minimum description length principle for deciding the partitioning of intervals. We demonstrate via empirical evaluation on several real-world data sets that better decision trees are obtained using the new multi-interval algorithm.},

@article{Athitsos2008a,
abstract = {This paper describes BoostMap, a method for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval under computationally expensive distance measures. Database and query objects are embedded into a vector space, in which distances can be measured efficiently. Each embedding is treated as a classifier that predicts for any three objects X, A, B whether X is closer to A or to B. It is shown that a linear combination of such embeddingbased classifiers naturally corresponds to an embedding and a distance measure. Based on this property, the BoostMap method reduces the problem of embedding construction to the classical boosting problem of combining many weak classifiers into an optimized strong classifier. The classification accuracy of the resulting strong classifier is a direct measure of the amount of nearest neighbor structure preserved by the embedding. An important property of BoostMap is that the embedding optimization criterion is equally valid in both metric and non-metric spaces. Performance is evaluated in databases of hand images, handwritten digits, and time series. In all cases, BoostMap significantly improves retrieval efficiency with small losses in accuracy compared to brute-force search. Moreover, BoostMap significantly outperforms existing nearest neighbor retrieval methods, such as Lipschitz embeddings, FastMap, and VP-trees.},

Much of this work has concentrated on the analysis of synthetic drugs, such as amphetamine and its analogues. In recent years, the analysis of both organic and elemental impurities as well as isotope ratios has advanced the usefulness of the techniques available. The application of specific chemometric methods to the derived analytical data has begun to provide the possibility of robust methods by which the resultant information can be interrogated.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years there has been an increasing interest in the development of robust systems, both analytical and statistical, to enable the linkage of seizures of illicit drug to each other. Much of this work has concentrated on the analysis of synthetic drugs, such as amphetamine and its analogues. In recent years, the analysis of both organic and elemental impurities as well as isotope ratios has advanced the usefulness of the techniques available. The application of specific chemometric methods to the derived analytical data has begun to provide the possibility of robust methods by which the resultant information can be interrogated.},

abstract = {When designing a business workflow, it is customary practice to create the control flow structure first and to ensure its correctness. Information about the flow of data is introduced subsequently into the workflow and its correctness is independently verified. Improper specification of data requirements of tasks and XOR splits can cause problems such as wrong branching at XOR splits and the failure of tasks to execute. Here we present a graph traversal algorithm called GTforDF for detecting data flow errors in both nested and unstructured workflows, and illustrate its operation on realistic examples. Two of these have interconnected loops and are free of control flow errors, and the third one is an unstructured loop-free workflow. Our approach extends and generalizes data flow verification methods that have been recently proposed. It also makes use of the concept of corresponding pairs lately introduced in control flow verification. It thus has the potential for development into a unified algorithmic procedure for the concurrent detection of control flow and data flow errors. The correctness of the algorithm has been proved theoretically. It has also been tested experimentally on many examples.},

@article{Ling2007,
abstract = {We propose EMD-L1: a fast and exact algorithm for computing the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between a pair of histograms. The efficiency of the new algorithm enables its application to problems that were previously prohibitive due to high time complexities. The proposed EMD-L1 significantly simplifies the original linear programming formulation of EMD. Exploiting the L1 metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L1 is reduced to O(N) from O(N2) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L1 formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L1 ground distance. To perform the EMD-L1 computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L1 as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N2), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L1 is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise. The results demonstrate that our EMD-L1-based solutions outperform previously reported state-of-the-art features and distance measures in solving the two tasks.},

abstract = {Data mining is the discovery of interesting, unexpected or valuable structures in large datasets. As such, it has two rather different aspects. One of these concerns large-scale, 'global' structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, 'local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary. This paper gives a lightning overview of data mining and its relation to statistics, with particular emphasis on tools for the detection of adverse drug reactions.},

@article{Khanna2010a,
abstract = {The clinical use of information technology in the dental profession has increased substantially in the past 10 to 20 years. In most developing countries an insufficiency of medical and dental specialists has increased the mortality of patients suffering from various diseases. Employing technology, especially artificial intelligence technology, in medical and dental application could reduce cost, time, human expertise and medical error. This approach has the potential to revolutionise the dental public health scenario in developing countries. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer programs that are designed to provide expert support for health professionals. The applications in dental sciences vary from dental emergencies to differential diagnosis of orofacial pain, radiographic interpretations, analysis of facial growth in orthodontia to prosthetic dentistry. However, despite the recognised need for CDSS, the implementation of these systems has been limited and slow. This can be attributed to lack of formal evaluation of the systems, challenges in developing standard representations, cost and practitioner scepticism about the value and feasibility of CDSS. Increasing public awareness of safety and quality has accelerated the adoption of generic knowledge based CDSS. Information technology applications for dental practice continue to develop rapidly and will hopefully contribute to reduce the morbidity and mortality of oral and maxillofacial diseases and in turn impact patient care.},

abstract = {Changes during software evolution and poor design decisions often lead to packages that are hard to understand and maintain, because they usually group together classes with unrelated responsibilities. One way to improve such packages is to decompose them into smaller, more cohesive packages. The difficulty lies in the fact that most definitions and interpretations of cohesion are rather vague and the multitude of measures proposed by researchers usually capture only one aspect of cohesion. We propose a new technique for automatic re-modularization of packages, which uses structural and semantic measures to decompose a package into smaller, more cohesive ones. The paper presents the new approach as well as an empirical study, which evaluates the decompositions proposed by the new technique. The results of the evaluation indicate that the decomposed packages have better cohesion without a deterioration of coupling and the re-modularizations proposed by the tool are also meaningful from a functional point of view.},

abstract = {A chance encounter between members of a random repertoire and a molecular target is characteristic of different biological systems, including the immune and olfactory pathways as well as combinatorial libraries. In such systems, the affinity between the target and members of the repertoire is distributed with a probability function describing the propensity of obtaining a particular affinity value. We have previously proposed a phenomenological receptor affinity distribution (RAD) formalism, which describes this probability function based on simple statistical considerations. In the present analysis, we use published data from diverse experimental systems, including phage display libraries, immunoglobulins and enzymes, to test the RAD model and to compare it to other affinity distribution formalisms. The RAD model is found to provide the best description for binding data for over eight orders of magnitude on the affinity scale, and to account for a relationship between repertoire size and the maximal obtainable affinity within different repertoires. This approach points to a potential universality of the rules that govern affinity distributions in biology.},

abstract = {Clustering, principal component analysis, clustering stability, gene expression Clustering is one of the most commonly used tools in the analysis of gene expression data. The usage in grouping genes is based on the premise that co-expression is a result of co-regulation. It is thus a preliminary step in extracting gene networks and inference of gene function. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning, i.e. no information on the class variable is assumed, and the objective is to find the "natural" groups in the data. However, most clustering algorithms generate a clustering even if the data has no inherent cluster structure, so external validation tools are required. The emergence of cluster structure depends on several choices: data representation and normalization, the choice of a similarity measure and clustering algorithm. In this chapter we extend the stability-based validation of cluster structure, and propose stability as a figure of merit that is useful for comparing clustering solutions, thus helping in making these choices. We use this framework to demonstrate the ability of principal component analysis (PCA) to extract features relavant to the cluster structure. We use stability as a tool for simultaneously choosing the number of principal components and the number of clusters.},

However, little is understood as how binders are enriched during the selection course. Next-generation sequencing offers the opportunity to open the black box and observe a large part of the population dynamics during the selection process.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: We have performed a semi-automated SELEX procedure on the model target streptavidin starting with a synthetic DNA oligonucleotide library and compared results obtained by the conventional analysis via cloning and Sanger sequencing with next-generation sequencing. In order to follow the population dynamics during the selection, pools from all selection rounds were barcoded and sequenced in parallel.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: High affinity aptamers can be readily identified simply by copy number enrichment in the first selection rounds. Based on our results, we suggest a new selection scheme that avoids a high number of iterative selection rounds while reducing time, PCR bias, and artifacts.},

abstract = {Context: Business process modeling is an essential part of understanding and redesigning the activities that a typical enterprise uses to achieve its business goals. The quality of a business process model has a significant impact on the development of any enterprise and IT support for that process. Objective: Since the insights on what constitutes modeling quality are constantly evolving, it is unclear whether research on business process modeling quality already covers all major aspects of modeling quality. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the state of the art on business process modeling quality: What aspects of process modeling quality have been addressed until now and which gaps remain to be covered? Method: We performed a systematic literature review of peer reviewed articles as published between 2000 and August 2013 on business process modeling quality. To analyze the contributions of the papers we use the Formal Concept Analysis technique. Results: We found 72 studies addressing quality aspects of business process models. These studies were classified into different dimensions: addressed model quality type, research goal, research method, and type of research result. Our findings suggest that there is no generally accepted framework of model quality types. Most research focuses on empirical and pragmatic quality aspects, specifically with respect to improving the understandability or readability of models. Among the various research methods, experimentation is the most popular one. The results from published research most often take the form of intangible knowledge. Conclusion: We believe there is a lack of an encompassing and generally accepted definition of business process modeling quality. This evidences the need for the development of a broader quality framework capable of dealing with the different aspects of business process modeling quality. Different dimensions of business process quality and of the process of modeling still require further research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The nearest neighbor classifier is one of the most used and well-known techniques for performing recognition tasks. It has also demonstrated itself to be one of the most useful algorithms in data mining in spite of its simplicity. However, the nearest neighbor classifier suffers from several drawbacks such as high storage requirements, low efficiency in classification response, and low noise tolerance. These weaknesses have been the subject of study for many researchers and many solutions have been proposed. Among them, one of the most promising solutions consists of reducing the data used for establishing a classification rule (training data) by means of selecting relevant prototypes. Many prototype selection methods exist in the literature and the research in this area is still advancing. Different properties could be observed in the definition of them, but no formal categorization has been established yet. This paper provides a survey of the prototype selection methods proposed in the literature from a theoretical and empirical point of view. Considering a theoretical point of view, we propose a taxonomy based on the main characteristics presented in prototype selection and we analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Empirically, we conduct an experimental study involving different sizes of data sets for measuring their performance in terms of accuracy, reduction capabilities, and runtime. The results obtained by all the methods studied have been verified by nonparametric statistical tests. Several remarks, guidelines, and recommendations are made for the use of prototype selection for nearest neighbor classification.},

abstract = {Customer churn prediction models aim to detect customers with a high propensity to attrite. Predictive accuracy, comprehensibility, and justifiability are three key aspects of a churn prediction model. An accurate model permits to correctly target future churners in a retention marketing campaign, while a comprehensible and intuitive rule-set allows to identify the main drivers for customers to churn, and to develop an effective retention strategy in accordance with domain knowledge. This paper provides an extended overview of the literature on the use of data mining in customer churn prediction modeling. It is shown that only limited attention has been paid to the comprehensibility and the intuitiveness of churn prediction models. Therefore, two novel data mining techniques are applied to churn prediction modeling, and benchmarked to traditional rule induction techniques such as C4.5 and RIPPER. Both AntMiner+ and ALBA are shown to induce accurate as well as comprehensible classification rule-sets. AntMiner+ is a high performing data mining technique based on the principles of Ant Colony Optimization that allows to include domain knowledge by imposing monotonicity constraints on the final rule-set. ALBA on the other hand combines the high predictive accuracy of a non-linear support vector machine model with the comprehensibility of the rule-set format. The results of the benchmarking experiments show that ALBA improves learning of classification techniques, resulting in comprehensible models with increased performance. AntMiner+ results in accurate, comprehensible, but most importantly justifiable models, unlike the other modeling techniques included in this study. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ability to determine the location and relative strength of all transcription-factor binding sites in a genome is important both for a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation and for effective promoter engineering in biotechnological applications. Here we present a bioinformatically driven experimental method to accurately define the DNA-binding sequence specificity of transcription factors. A generalized profile was used as a predictive quantitative model for binding sites, and its parameters were estimated from in vitro-selected ligands using standard hidden Markov model training algorithms. Computer simulations showed that several thousand low- to medium-affinity sequences are required to generate a profile of desired accuracy. To produce data on this scale, we applied high-throughput genomics methods to the biochemical problem addressed here. A method combining systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) protocols was coupled to an automated quality-controlled sequence extraction procedure based on Phred quality scores. This allowed the sequencing of a database of more than 10,000 potential DNA ligands for the CTF/NFI transcription factor. The resulting binding-site model defines the sequence specificity of this protein with a high degree of accuracy not achieved earlier and thereby makes it possible to identify previously unknown regulatory sequences in genomic DNA. A covariance analysis of the selected sites revealed non-independent base preferences at different nucleotide positions, providing insight into the binding mechanism.},

However, the state-of-the-art pattern-based clustering methods are inefficient and provide no metric to measure the clustering quality. This paper presents a new pattern-based subspace clustering method, which can tackle the problems mentioned above. Observing the analogy between mining frequent itemsets and discovering subspace clusters, we apply pattern tree - a structure used in frequent itemsets mining to determining the target subspaces by scanning the database once, which can be done efficiently in large datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a general clustering quality evaluation model to guide the identifying of meaningful clusters. The proposed new method enables the users to set flexibly proper quality-control parameters to meet different needs. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that our method outperforms the existing methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In recent years, there have been various efforts to overcome the limitations of standard clustering approaches for the analysis of gene expression data by grouping genes and samples simultaneously. The underlying concept, which is often referred to as biclustering, allows to identify sets of genes sharing compatible expression patterns across subsets of samples, and its usefulness has been demonstrated for different organisms and datasets. Several biclustering methods have been proposed in the literature; however, it is not clear how the different techniques compare with each other with respect to the biological relevance of the clusters as well as with other characteristics such as robustness and sensitivity to noise. Accordingly, no guidelines concerning the choice of the biclustering method are currently available. RESULTS: First, this paper provides a methodology for comparing and validating biclustering methods that includes a simple binary reference model. Although this model captures the essential features of most biclustering approaches, it is still simple enough to exactly determine all optimal groupings; to this end, we propose a fast divide-and-conquer algorithm (Bimax). Second, we evaluate the performance of five salient biclustering algorithms together with the reference model and a hierarchical clustering method on various synthetic and real datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. The comparison reveals that (1) biclustering in general has advantages over a conventional hierarchical clustering approach, (2) there are considerable performance differences between the tested methods and (3) already the simple reference model delivers relevant patterns within all considered settings.},

abstract = {Clustering in high-dimensional spaces is a difficult problem which is recurrent in many domains, for example in image analysis. The difficulty is due to the fact that high-dimensional data usually exist in different low-dimensional subspaces hidden in the original space. A family of Gaussian mixture models designed for high-dimensional data which combine the ideas of subspace clustering and parsimonious modeling are presented. These models give rise to a clustering method based on the expectationmaximization algorithm which is called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC). In order to correctly fit the data, HDDC estimates the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of each group. Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that HDDC outperforms existing methods for clustering high-dimensional data.},

abstract = {Community Question Answering (cQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers and MSN QnA, facilitate knowledge sharing through question answering by an online community of users. These services include incentive mechanisms to entice participation and self-regulate the quality of the content contributed by the users. In order to encourage quality contributions, community members are asked to nominate the \&amp;\#x02018;best\&amp;\#x02019; among the answers provided to a question. The service then awards extra points to the author who provided the winning answer and to the voters who cast their vote for that answer. The best answers are typically selected by plurality voting, a scheme that is simple, yet vulnerable to random voting and collusion. We propose a weighted voting method that incorporates information about the voters\&amp;\#x02019; behavior. It assigns a score to each voter that captures the level of agreement with other voters. It uses the voter scores to aggregate the votes and determine the best answer. The mathematical formulation leads to the application of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem which guarantees the existence of a voter scoring function that satisfies the starting axiom. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through simulations and analysis of real cQA service data.},

abstract = {With over 2,000 publications, including about 250 reviews, resulting from a SciFinder search in just a two year period (2009-2010), the field of aptamer research has continuously generated lots of interest in the scientific community. Aptamers, first reported by three groups independently in 1990, are the artificial single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences (more recently, peptides) that fold into secondary and tertiary structures making them bind to certain targets with extremely high specificity. Owing to the high specific affinity of an aptamer to its target molecule (small molecules, proteins and even entire cells), it is thought to resemble chemical antibodies, with the dissociation constants ranging from nanomolar to picomolar level. Aptamers have a number of unique features which make them a more effective choice than antibodies. First, aptamers can be screened via in vitro process against a synthetic library, making it possible to target any molecules (from small inorganic ions to intact cells), overcoming the limit of having to use cell lines or animals, as is necessary for antibodies. Second, aptamers, once selected, can undergo subsequent amplification through polymerase chain reaction to produce a large quantity with high purity. Third, the simple chemical structure of aptamer makes it easily amendable to further modifications with functional groups according to different purposes. Finally, aptamers are much more stable than antibodies, making them suitable in applications requiring harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature or extreme pH).The applications of aptamers remain very dynamic, with increasing explorations in the fields of biosensing, diagnostics and therapeutics. There have been a numbers of excellent reviews in recent years with different emphases.4-8 Herein, as the first review of aptamers on Analytical Chemistry, we attempt to cover major progresses in bioanalytical applications of aptamers in the past 2 years.},

abstract = {Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

Word normalization in improved composition vector method took into account these problems and achieved better performance in evolutionary analysis. The word normalization is desirable, but not sufficient, because it assumes that the four bases A, C, T, and G occur randomly with equal chance. This paper proposed an improved word normalization which uses Markov model to estimate exact k-word distribution according to observed biological sequence and thus has the ability to adjust the background information of the k-word frequencies in biological sequences. The improved word normalization was tested with three experiments and compared with the existing word normalization. The experiment results confirm that the improved word normalization using Markov model to estimate the exact k-word distribution in biological sequences is more efficient.},

With the categorizing framework, we continue our efforts toward building an integrated system for intelligent feature selection. A unifying platform is proposed as an intermediate step. An illustrative example is presented to show how existing feature selection algorithms can be integrated into a meta algorithm that can take advantage of individual algorithms. An added advantage of doing so is to help a user employ a suitable algorithm without knowing details of each algorithm. Some real-world applications are included to demonstrate the use of feature selection in data mining. We conclude this work by identifying trends and challenges of feature selection research and development.},

@article{Levine2007a,
abstract = {Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a procedure by which a mixture of nucleic acids that vary in sequence can be separated into pure components with the goal of isolating those with specific biochemical activities. The basic idea is to combine the mixture with a specific target molecule and then separate the target-NA complex from the resulting reaction. The target-NA complex is then separated by mechanical means (for example by filtration), the NA is then eluted from the complex, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the process repeated. After several rounds, one should be left with a pool of [NA] that consists mostly of the species in the original pool that best binds to the target. In Irvine et al. [Irvine, D., Tuerk, C., Gold, L., 1991. SELEXION, systematic evolution of nucleic acids by exponential enrichment with integrated optimization by non-linear analysis. J. Mol. Biol. 222, 739-761] a mathematical analysis of this process was given. In this paper we revisit Irvine et al. [Ibid]. By rewriting the equations for the SELEX process, we considerably reduce the labor of computing the round to round distribution of nucleic acid fractions. We also establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the SELEX process to converge to a pool consisting solely of the best binding nucleic acid to a fixed target in a manner that maximizes the percentage of bound target. The assumption is that there is a single nucleic acid binding site on the target that permits occupation by not more than one nucleic acid. We analyze the case for which there is no background loss (no support losses and no free [NA] left on the support). We then examine the case in which such there are such losses. The significance of the analysis is that it suggests an experimental approach for the SELEX process as defined in Irvine et al. [Ibid] to converge to a pool consisting of a single best binding nucleic acid without recourse to any a priori information about the nature of the binding constants or the distribution of the individual nucleic acid fragments. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For applications of data mining techniques in geosciences, through mining spatial databases which are constructed with geophysical and geochemical data measured in fields, critical knowledge, such as the spatial distribution of geological targets, the geophysical and geochemical characteristics of geological targets, the differentiation among the geological targets, and the relationship among geophysical and geochemical data, can be discovered. Due to the complexity of geophysical and geochemical data, traditional mining methods of cluster analysis and association analysis have limitations in processing complex data. In this paper, a clustering algorithm based on density and adaptive density-reachable is presented which has the ability to handle clusters of arbitrary shapes, sizes, and densities. For association analysis, mining the continuous attributes may reveal useful and interesting insights about the data objects in geoscientific applications. An approach for distance-based quantitative association analysis is presented in this paper. Experiments and applications indicate that the algorithm and approach are effective in real-world applications. },

abstract = {Background: There are too many design options for software effort estimators. How can we best explore them all? Aim: We seek aspects on general principles of effort estimation that can guide the design of effort estimators. Method: We identified the essential assumption of analogy-based effort estimation, i.e., the immediate neighbors of a project offer stable conclusions about that project. We test that assumption by generating a binary tree of clusters of effort data and comparing the variance of supertrees versus smaller subtrees. Results: For 10 data sets (from Coc81, Nasa93, Desharnais, Albrecht, ISBSG, and data from Turkish companies), we found: 1) The estimation variance of cluster subtrees is usually larger than that of cluster supertrees; 2) if analogy is restricted to the cluster trees with lower variance, then effort estimates have a significantly lower error (measured using MRE, AR, and Pred(25) with a Wilcoxon test, 95 percent confidence, compared to nearest neighbor methods that use neighborhoods of a fixed size). Conclusion: Estimation by analogy can be significantly improved by a dynamic selection of nearest neighbors, using only the project data from regions with small variance.},

abstract = {Estrogen-related receptors (ERR), ERR alpha (ERR$\alpha$) and ERR gamma (ERR$\gamma$), are orphan nuclear receptors implicated in breast cancer that function similarly in the regulation of oxidative metabolism genes. Paradoxically, in clinical studies, high levels of ERR$\alpha$ are associated with poor outcomes whereas high levels of ERR$\gamma$ are associated with a favorable course. Recent studies suggest that ERR$\alpha$ may indeed promote breast tumor growth. The roles of ERR$\gamma$ in breast cancer progression and how ERR$\alpha$ and ERR$\gamma$ may differentially affect cancer growth are unclear. In mammary carcinoma cells that do not express endogenous ERR$\gamma$, we found that ectopic expression of ERR$\gamma$ enhanced oxidative metabolism in vitro and inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. In contrast, ectopic expression of the ERR$\alpha$ coactivator PGC-1$\alpha$ enhanced oxidative metabolism but did not affect tumor growth. Notably, ERR$\gamma$ activated expression of a genetic program characteristic of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). This program was apparent by changes in cellular morphology, upregulation of epithelial cell markers, downregulation of mesenchymal markers, and decreased cellular invasiveness. We determined that this program was also associated with upregulation of E-cadherin, which is activated directly by ERR$\gamma$. In contrast, PGC-1$\alpha$ activated only a subset of genes characteristic of the MET program and, unlike ERR$\gamma$, did not upregulate E-cadherin. In conclusion, these results show that ERR$\gamma$ induces E-cadherin, promotes MET, and suppresses breast cancer growth. Our findings suggest that ERR$\gamma$ agonists may have applications in the treatment of breast cancer.},

abstract = {SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) is an experimental procedure that allows the extraction, from an initially random pool of DNA, of those oligomers with high affinity for a given DNA-binding protein. We address what is a suitable experimental and computational procedure to infer parameters of transcription factor-DNA interaction from SELEX experiments. To answer this, we use a biophysical model of transcription factor-DNA interactions to quantitatively model SELEX. We show that a standard procedure is unsuitable for obtaining accurate interaction parameters. However, we theoretically show that a modified experiment in which chemical potential is fixed through different rounds of the experiment allows robust generation of an appropriate dataset. Based on our quantitative model, we propose a novel bioinformatic method of data analysis for such a modified experiment and apply it to extract the interaction parameters for a mammalian transcription factor CTF/NFI. From a practical point of view, our method results in a significantly improved false positive/false negative trade-off, as compared to both the standard information theory based method and a widely used empirically formulated procedure.},

abstract = {Aptamers that bind small molecules can serve as basic biosensing platforms. Evaluation of the binding constant between an aptamer and a small molecule helps to determine the effectiveness of the aptamer-based sensors. Binding constants are often measured by a series of experiments with varying ligand or aptamer concentrations. Such experiments are time-consuming, material nonprudent, and prone to low reproducibility. Here, we use laser tweezers to determine the dissociation constant for aptamer-ligand interactions at the single-molecule level from only one ligand concentration. Using an adenosine 5'-triphosphate disodium salt (ATP) binding aptamer as an example, we have observed that the mechanical stabilities of aptamers bound with ATP are higher than those without a ligand. Comparison of the change in free energy of unfolding ($\Delta$G(unfold)) between these two aptamers yields a $\Delta$G of 33 ± 4 kJ/mol for the binding. By applying a Hess-like cycle at room temperature, we obtained a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 2.0 ± 0.2 $\mu$M, a value consistent with the K(d) obtained from our equilibrated capillary electrophoresis (CE) (2.4 ± 0.4 $\mu$M) and close to that determined by affinity chromatography in the literature (6 ± 3 $\mu$M). We anticipate that our laser tweezers and CE methodologies may be used to more conveniently evaluate the binding between receptors and ligands and also serve as analytical tools for force-based biosensing.},

abstract = {Structure-based virtual screening today is basically organized as a sequential process where the molecules of a screening library are evaluated for instance with respect to their fit with a biological target. In this paper, we present a novel structure-based screening paradigm avoiding sequential searching and therefore enabling sublinear runtime behavior. We implemented the novel paradigm in the virtual screening tool TrixX and successfully applied it in screening experiments on four targets from relevant therapeutic areas. With the screening paradigm implemented in TrixX, we propose some important extensions and modifications to traditional virtual screening approaches: Instead of processing all compounds in the screening library sequentially, TrixX first analyzes the geometric and physicochemical binding site characteristics and then draws compounds with matching features from a compound catalog. The catalog organizes the compounds by their physicochemical and geometric features making use of relational database technology with indexed tables in order to support efficient queries for compounds with specific features. A key element of the compound catalog is a highly selective geometric descriptor that carries information on the type of functional groups of the compound, their Euclidian distance, the preferred interaction direction of each functional group, and the location of steric bulk around the triangle. In a re-docking experiment with 200 protein-ligand complexes, we could show that TrixX is able to correctly predict the location of ligand functional groups in co-crystallized complexes. In a retrospective virtual screening experiment for four different targets, the enrichment factors of TrixX are comparable to the enrichment factors of FlexX and FlexX-Scan. With computing times clearly below one second per compound, TrixX counts among the fastest virtual screening tools currently available and is nearly two orders of magnitude faster than standard FlexX.},

abstract = {Aptamers are oligonucleotides derived from an in vitro evolution process called SELEX. Aptamers have been evolved to bind proteins which are associated with a number of disease states. Using this method, many powerful antagonists of such proteins have been found. In order for these antagonists to work in animal models of disease and in humans, it is necessary to modify the aptamers. First of all, sugar modifications of nucleoside triphosphates are necessary to render the resulting aptamers resistant to nucleases found in serum. Changing the 2'OH groups of ribose to 2'F or 2'NH2 groups yields aptamers which are long lived in blood. The relatively low molecular weight of aptamers (8000-12000) leads to rapid clearance from the blood. Aptamers can be kept in the circulation from hours to days by conjugating them to higher molecular weight vehicles. When modified, conjugated aptamers are injected into animals, they inhibit physiological functions known to be associated with their target proteins. A new approach to diagnostics is also described. Aptamer arrays on solid surfaces will become available rapidly because the SELEX protocol has been successfully automated. The use of photo-cross-linkable aptamers will allow the covalent attachment of aptamers to their cognate proteins, with very low backgrounds from other proteins in body fluids. Finally, protein staining with any reagent which distinguishes functional groups of amino acids from those of nucleic acids (and the solid support) will give a direct readout of proteins on the solid support.},

abstract = {This paper concerns approximate nearest neighbor searching algorithms, which have become increasingly important, especially in high dimen- sional perception areas such as computer vision, with dozens of publica- tions in recent years. Much of this enthusiasm is due to a successful new approximate nearest neighbor approach called Locality Sensitive Hash- ing (LSH). In this paper we ask the question: can earlier spatial data structure approaches to exact nearest neighbor, such as metric trees, be altered to provide approximate answers to proximity queries and if so, how? We introduce a new kind of metric tree that allows overlap: certain datapoints may appear in both the children of a parent. We also intro- duce new approximate k-NN search algorithms on this structure. We show why these structures should be able to exploit the same random- projection-based approximations that LSH enjoys, but with a simpler al- gorithm and perhaps with greater efficiency. We then provide a detailed empirical evaluation on five large, high dimensional datasets which show up to 31-fold accelerations over LSH.

cut criterion. While the spectral relaxation is known to be loose, it has been shown
recently that a non-linear eigenproblem yields a tight relaxation of the Cheeger
cut. In this paper, we extend this result considerably by providing a characterization
of all balanced graph cuts which allow for a tight relaxation. Although
the resulting optimization problems are non-convex and non-smooth, we provide
an efficient first-order scheme which scales to large graphs. Moreover, our approach
comes with the quality guarantee that given any partition as initialization
the algorithm either outputs a better partition or it stops immediately.},

@article{Seo2013a,
abstract = {Context Along with expert judgment, analogy-based estimation, and algorithmic methods (such as Function point analysis and COCOMO), Least Squares Regression (LSR) has been one of the most commonly studied software effort estimation methods. However, an effort estimation model using LSR, a single LSR model, is highly affected by the data distribution. Specifically, if the data set is scattered and the data do not sit closely on the single LSR model line (do not closely map to a linear structure) then the model usually shows poor performance. In order to overcome this drawback of the LSR model, a data partitioning-based approach can be considered as one of the solutions to alleviate the effect of data distribution. Even though clustering-based approaches have been introduced, they still have potential problems to provide accurate and stable effort estimates. Objective In this paper, we propose a new data partitioning-based approach to achieve more accurate and stable effort estimates via LSR. This approach also provides an effort prediction interval that is useful to describe the uncertainty of the estimates. Method Empirical experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by comparing with the basic LSR approach and clustering-based approaches, based on industrial data sets (two subsets of the ISBSG (Release 9) data set and one industrial data set collected from a banking institution). Results The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only improves the accuracy of effort estimation more significantly than that of other approaches, but it also achieves robust and stable results according to the degree of data partitioning. Conclusion Compared with the other considered approaches, the proposed approach shows a superior performance by alleviating the effect of data distribution that is a major practical issue in software effort estimation. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

When combined with genomic libraries and using RNA-binding proteins as baits, Genomic SELEX used with high-throughput sequencing enables the discovery of genomic RNA aptamers and the identification of RNA-protein interaction networks. Here we describe how to construct and analyze genomic libraries, how to choose baits for selections, how to perform the selection procedure and finally how to analyze the enriched sequences derived from deep sequencing. As a control procedure, we recommend performing a " Neutral" SELEX experiment in parallel to the selection, omitting the selection step. This control experiment provides a background signal for comparison with the positively selected pool. We also recommend deep sequencing the initial library in order to facilitate the final in silico analysis of enrichment with respect to the initial levels. Counter selection procedures, using modified or inactive baits, allow strengthening the binding specificity of the winning selected sequences. © 2010.},

abstract = {Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) is an experimental procedure that allows extraction, from an initially random pool of oligonucleotides, of the oligomers with a desired binding affinity for a given molecular target. The procedure can be used to infer the strongest binders for a given DNA or RNA binding protein, and the highest affinity binding sequences isolated through SELEX can have numerous research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Recently, important new modifications of the SELEX protocol have been proposed. In particular, a modification of the standard SELEX procedure allows generating a dataset from which protein-DNA interaction parameters can be determined with unprecedented accuracy. Another variant of SELEX allows investigating interactions of a protein with nucleic-acid fragments derived from the entire genome of an organism. We review here different SELEX-based methods, with particular emphasis on the experimental design and on the applications aimed at inferring protein-DNA interactions.

@article{Chen2007c,
abstract = {Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an in vitro combinatorial engineering approach to enrich aptamers from a library of nucleic acids ligands by iterative extraction and amplification of receptor-bound ligands. Aptamers are the selected nucleic acid ligands with high receptor-binding affinity. Typically, they are obtained in single-receptor SELEX experiments where the ligand library is incubated with receptor molecules of a single identity, e.g., a purified protein. For years, aptamers have been shown to be valuable for biomedical applications and research. To further explore the power of SELEX technology, the idea of complex SELEX was proposed to obtain multiple aptamers by incubating the ligand library with multiple species of receptors. However, the reports on complex SELEX have been few, possible due to the ignorance of the effects of experimental variables. To address this problem, computer simulations should be useful. A major task of simulating complex SELEX is to solve interdependent binding equilibrium equations for binding events among heterogeneous ligands and receptors. Although a detailed subpooling model was developed, that model could be useful to simulate complex SELEX against at most four species of receptors, because the demand of computer memory grew exponentially with the number of receptor species. Here we develop a novel, condensed subpooling model where ligands of similar characteristic affinity are first pooled together regardless of receptor-specificity, and then divided into partial subpools receptor-specifically. With this model, the need of computer memory grows only linearly with receptor number. In the simulation of SELEX against four receptors, our results are the same or very similar to earlier work. We have further simulated SELEX against 100 heterogeneous receptors. We suggest that our computation method can be applied to other research fields where binding events between heterogeneous ligands and receptors are involved. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. We argue in this position paper that data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, information retrieval, data integration, etc., are necessary solutions to deal with software data. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created.
In order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners. Software engineering researchers can get inspired by other fields, such as, bioinformatics, where results of mining and analyzing biological data are often stored in databases shared across the world.},

abstract = { Biclustering is an important problem that arises in diverse applications, including analysis of gene expression and drug interaction data. The problem can be formalized in various ways through different interpretation of data and associated optimization functions. We focus on the problem of finding unusually dense patterns in binary (0-1) matrices. This formulation is appropriate for analyzing experimental datasets that come from not only binary quantization of gene expression data, but also more comprehensive datasets such as gene-feature matrices that include functions of coded proteins and motifs in the coding sequence. We formalize the notion of an "unusually" dense submatrix to evaluate the interestingness of a pattern in terms of statistical significance based on the assumption of a uniform memoryless source. We then simplify it to assess statistical significance of discovered patterns. Using statistical significance as an objective function, we formulate the problem as one of finding significant dense submatrices of a large sparse matrix. Adopting a simple iterative heuristic along with randomized initialization techniques, we derive fast algorithms for discovering binary biclusters. We conduct experiments on a binary gene-feature matrix and a quantized breast tumor gene expression matrix. Our experimental results show that the proposed method quickly discovers all interesting patterns in these datasets.},

abstract = {SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) is a process that involves the progressive purification from a combinatorial library of nucleic acid ligands with a high affinity for a particular target by repeated rounds of partitioning and amplification. With the development of aptamer technology over the last decade, various modified SELEX processes have arisen that allow various aptamers to be developed against a wide variety of molecules, irrespective of the target size. In the present review, the separation methods used in such SELEX processes are reviewed.},

abstract = {To estimate how sophisticated should an empirical scoring function be to ensure successful docking, scoring and virtual screening a new scoring function NScore (naive score) has been developed and tested. NScore is an extremely simple function and has the minimum possible number of parameters; nevertheless, it allows all the main effects determining the ligand-protein interaction to be taken into account. The fundamental difference of NScore from the currently used empirical functions is that all its parameters are selected on the basis of general physical considerations, without any adjustment or training with the use of experimental data on ligand-protein interaction. The results of docking and scoring with the use of NScore in an independent test sets of proteins and ligands have proved to be as good as those yielded by the ICM, GOLD, and Glide software packages, which use sophisticated empirical scoring functions. With respect to some parameters, the results of docking with the use of NScore are even better than those obtained using other functions. Since no training set is used in the development of NScore, this scoring function is indeed versatile in that it does not depend on the specific goal or target. We have performed virtual screening for ten targets and obtained results almost as good as those yielded by the Glide and better than GOLD and DOCK software.},

abstract = {Success in small molecule screening relies heavily on the preselection of compounds. Here, we present a strategy for the enrichment of chemical libraries with potentially bioactive compounds integrating the collected knowledge of medicinal chemistry. Employing a genetic algorithm, substructures typically occurring in bioactive compounds were identified using the World Drug Index. Availability of compounds containing the selected substructures was analysed in vendor libraries, and the substructure-specific sublibraries were assembled. Compounds containing reactive, undesired functional groups were omitted. Using a diversity filter for both physico-chemical properties and the substructure composition, the compounds of all the sublibraries were ranked. Accordingly, a screening collection of 16,671 compounds was selected. Diversity and chemical space coverage of the collection indicate that it is highly diverse and well-placed in the chemical space spanned by bioactive compounds. Furthermore, secondary assay-validated hits presented in this study show the practical relevance of our library design strategy.},

McGraw and Wong introduced this "common language effect size statistic" for normal distributions and then proposed an approximate estimation for any continuous distribution. In addition, they generalized CL to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case. In the current paper a different generalization of CL, called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations ofCL are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.},

We consider classification (category learning) tasks, pro- pose a boosting algorithm for human learn- ers and give theoretical justifications. We conduct experiments using Amazon’s Me- chanical Turk on two synthetic datasets – a crosshair task with a nonlinear decision boundary and a gabor patch task with a lin- ear boundary but which is inaccessible to hu- man learners – and one real world dataset – the Opinion Spam detection task introduced in (Ott et al., 2011). Our results show that boosting human learners produces gains in accuracy and can overcome some fundamen- tal limitations of human learners.},

It is also necessary to examine mental models using a computer simulation. The Computer simulation requires expressions, which can be translated into computer codes. Therefore, model builders need to translate their model from their own natural language to simulation-friendly language, i.e. stock flow diagrams in System Dynamics. It is widely recognised that this translation is sometimes difficult not only for people who are beginners of System Dynamics but also for people who are experienced in the field. This paper discusses a possible translation procedure and shows an application of it. The proposed procedure is designed to use a subset of a natural language as an intermediate language. This idea is applicable regardless of variety of natural language.},

abstract = {SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) is a procedure by which a mixture of nucleic acids can be fractionated with the goal of identifying those with specific biochemical activities. One combines the mixture with a specific target molecule and then separates the target-NA complex from the resulting reactions. The target-NA complex is separated from the unbound NA by mechanical means (such as by filtration), the NA is eluted from the complex, amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction), and the process repeated. After several rounds, one should be left with the nucleic acids that best bind to the target. The problem was first formulated mathematically in Irvine et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 222:739-761, 1991). In Levine and Nilsen-Hamilton (Comput. Biol. Chem. 31:11-25, 2007), a mathematical analysis of the process was given. In Vant-Hull et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 278:579-597, 1998), multiple target SELEX was considered. It was assumed that each target has a single nucleic acid binding site that permits occupation by no more than one nucleic acid. Here, we revisit Vant-Hull et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 278:579-597, 1998) using the same assumptions. The iteration scheme is shown to be convergent and a simplified algorithm is given. Our interest here is in the behavior of the multiple target SELEX process as a discrete "time" dynamical system. Our goal is to characterize the limiting states and their dependence on the initial distribution of nucleic acid and target fraction components. (In multiple target SELEX, we vary the target component fractions, but not their concentrations, as fixed and the initial pool of nucleic acids as a variable starting condition). Given N nucleic acids and a target consisting of M subtarget component species, there is an M × N matrix of affinities, the (i,j) entry corresponding to the affinity of the jth nucleic acid for the ith subtarget. We give a structure condition on this matrix that is equivalent to the following statement: For any initial pool of nucleic acids such that all N species are represented, the dynamical system defined by the multiple target SELEX process will converge to a unique subset of nucleic acids, each of whose concentrations depend only upon the total nucleic acid concentration, the initial fractional target distribution (both of which are assumed to be the same from round to round), and the overall limiting association constant. (The overall association constant is the equilibrium constant for the system of MN reactions when viewed as a composite single reaction). This condition is equivalent to the statement that every member of a certain family of chemical potentials at infinite target dilution can have at most one critical point. (The condition replaces the statement for single target SELEX that the dynamical system generated via the process always converges to a pool that contains only the nucleic acid that binds best to the target). This suggests that the effectiveness of multiple target SELEX as a separation procedure may not be as useful as single target SELEX unless the thermodynamic properties of these chemical potentials are well understood.},

abstract = {Clustering high dimensional data has become a challenge in data mining due to the curse of dimensionality. To solve this problem, subspace clustering has been defined as an extension of traditional clustering that seeks to find clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions within a dataset. This paper presents a new subspace clustering algorithm that calculates the local feature weights automatically in an EM-based clustering process. In the algorithm, the features are locally weighted by using a new unsupervised weighting method, as a means to minimize a proposed clustering criterion that takes into account both the average intra-clusters compactness and the average inter-clusters separation for subspace clustering. For the purposes of capturing accurate subspace information, an additional outlier detection process is presented to identify the possible local outliers of subspace clusters, and is embedded between the E-step and M-step of the algorithm. The method has been evaluated in clustering real-world gene expression data and high dimensional artificial data with outliers, and the experimental results have shown its effectiveness.},

However, as the important statistical properties of words in biological sequence, how to use the overlapping structures and background information of the words to improve sequence comparison is still a problem. This paper proposed a new statistical method that integrates the overlapping structures and the background information of the words in biological sequences. To assess the effectiveness of this integration for sequence comparison, two sets of evaluation experiments were taken to test the proposed model. The first one, performed via receiver operating curve analysis, is the application of proposed method in discrimination between functionally related regulatory sequences and unrelated sequences, intron and exon. The second experiment is to evaluate the performance of the proposed method with f-measure for clustering Hepatitis E virus genotypes. It was demonstrated that the proposed method integrating the overlapping structures and the background information of words significantly improves biological sequence comparison and outperforms the existing models.},

abstract = {Recently, a number of researchers have proposed spectral algorithms for learning models of dynam- ical systems—for example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Partially Observable Markov Decision Pro- cesses (POMDPs), and Transformed Predictive State Representations (TPSRs). These algorithms are attrac- tive since they are statistically consistent and not sub- ject to local optima. However, they are batch methods: they need to store their entire training data set in mem- ory at once and operate on it as a large matrix, and so they cannot scale to extremely large data sets (ei- ther many examples or many features per example). In turn, this restriction limits their ability to learn accurate models of complex systems. To overcome these lim- itations, we propose a new online spectral algorithm, which uses tricks such as incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and random projections to scale to much larger data sets and more complex systems than previous methods. We demonstrate the new method on an inertial measurement prediction task and a high- bandwidth video mapping task and we illustrate desir- able behaviors such as “closing the loop,” where the la- tent state representation changes suddenly as the learner recognizes that it has returned to a previously known place.

Moreover, the approval of an aptamer for vascular endothelial growth factor by the US Food and Drug Administration highlights the potential of aptamers for therapeutic applications. This review summarizes recent developments and demonstrates that aptamers are valuable tools for diagnostics, purification processes, target validation, drug discovery, and even therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {During the past decade, solving constrained opti- mization problems with evolutionary algorithms has received considerable attention among researchers and practitioners. Cai and Wang’s method (abbreviated as CW method) is a recent constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm proposed by the authors. However, its main shortcoming is that a trial-and- error process has to be used to choose suitable parameters. To overcome the above shortcoming, this paper proposes an improved version of the CW method, called CMODE, which combines multiobjective optimization with differential evolu- tion to deal with constrained optimization problems. Like its predecessor CW, the comparison of individuals in CMODE is also based on multiobjective optimization. In CMODE, however, differential evolution serves as the search engine. In addition, a novel infeasible solution replacement mechanism based on multiobjective optimization is proposed, with the purpose of guiding the population toward promising solutions and the feasible region simultaneously. The performance of CMODE is evaluated on 24 benchmark test functions. It is shown empirically that CMODE is capable of producing highly competitive results compared with some other state-of-the-art approaches in the community of constrained evolutionary optimization},

abstract = {Background: The accurate prediction of where faults are likely to occur in code can help direct test effort, reduce costs and improve the quality of software. Objective: We investigate how the context of models, the independent variables used and the modelling techniques applied, influence the performance of fault prediction models. Method:We used a systematic literature review to identify 208 fault prediction studies published from January 2000 to December 2010. We synthesise the quantitative and qualitative results of 36 studies which report sufficient contextual and methodological information according to the criteria we develop and apply. Results: The models that perform well tend to be based on simple modelling techniques such as Na??ve Bayes or Logistic Regression. Combinations of independent variables have been used by models that perform well. Feature selection has been applied to these combinations when models are performing particularly well. Conclusion: The methodology used to build models seems to be influential to predictive performance. Although there are a set of fault prediction studies in which confidence is possible, more studies are needed that use a reliable methodology and which report their context, methodology and performance comprehensively.},

We have modified this method in two steps-use of fluorescent labels for DNA quantification and use of magnetic beads for target immobilization. Thus, radioactive labelling is avoided. Immobilization on magnetic beads enables easy handling, use of very small amounts of target for the aptamer selection, rapid and efficient separation of bound and unbound molecules, and stringent washing steps. We have called this modified SELEX technology FluMag-SELEX. With FluMag-SELEX we have provided a methodological background for our objective of being able to select DNA aptamers for targets with very different properties and size. These aptamers will be applied as new biosensor receptors. In this work selection of streptavidin-specific aptamers by FluMag-SELEX is described. The streptavidin-specific aptamers will be used to check the surface occupancy of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads with biotinylated molecules after immobilization procedures.},

abstract = {A method is presented to partition a given set of data entries embedded in Euclidean space by recursively bisecting clusters into smaller ones. The initial set is subdivided into two subsets whose centroids are farthest from each other, and the process is repeated recursively on each subset. An approximate algorithm is proposed to solve the original integer programming problem which is NP-hard. Experimental evidence shows that the clustering method often outperforms a standard spectral clustering method, albeit at a slightly higher computational cost. The paper also discusses improvements of the standard K-means algorithm. Specifically, the clustering quality resulting from the K-means technique can be significantly enhanced by using the proposed algorithm for its initialization.},

@article{Song2014a,
abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly configurable. While this has many benefits, it also makes some software engineering tasks,such as software testing, much harder. This is because, in theory,unique errors could be hiding in any configuration, and, therefore,every configuration may need to undergo expensive testing. As this is generally infeasible, developers need cost-effective technique for selecting which specific configurations they will test. One popular selection approach is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), where the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array (a set of configurations) in which all t-way combinations of configuration option settings appear at least once. In prior work, we demonstrated several limitations of the CIT approach. In particular, we found that a given system's effective configuration space - the minimal set of configurations needed to achieve a specific goal - could comprise only a tiny subset of the system's full configuration space. We also found that effective configuration space may not be well approximated by t-way covering arrays. Based on these insights we have developed an algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree). iTree is an iterative learning algorithm that efficiently searches for a small set of configurations that closely approximates a system's effective configuration space. On each iteration iTree tests the system on a small sample of carefully chosen configurations, monitors the system's behaviors, and then applies machine learning techniques to discover which combinations of option settings are potentially responsible for any newly observed behaviors. This information is used in the next iteration to pick a new sample of configurations that are likely to reveal further new behaviors. In prior work, we presented an initial version of iTree and performed an initial evaluation with promising results. This paper presents an improved iTree algorithm in greater detail. The - ey improvements are based on our use of composite proto-interactions - a construct that improves iTree's ability to correctly learn key configuration option combinations, which in turn significantly improves iTree's running time, without sacrificing effectiveness. Finally, the paper presents a detailed evaluation of the improved iTree algorithm by comparing the coverage it achieves versus that of covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets, including a significantly expanded scalability evaluation with the \~{} 1M-LOC MySQL. Our results strongly suggest that the improved iTree algorithm is highly scalable and can identify a high-coverage test set of configurations more effectively than existing methods.},

In this paper, we propose two recursive PCA algorithms for adaptive process monitoring. The paper starts with an efficient approach to updating the correlation matrix recursively. The algorithms, using rank-one modification and Lanczos tridiagonalization, are then proposed and their computational complexity is compared. The number of principal components and the confidence limits for process monitoring are also determined recursively. A complete adaptive monitoring algorithm that addresses the issues of missing values and outlines is presented. Finally, the proposed algorithms are applied to a rapid thermal annealing process in semiconductor processing for adaptive monitoring.},

The difficulty is due to the fact that high-dimensional data usually exist in different low-dimensional subspaces hidden in the original space. A family of Gaussian mixture models designed for high-dimensional data which combine the ideas of subspace clustering and parsimonious modeling are presented. These models give rise to a clustering method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm which is called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC). In order to correctly fit the data, HDDC estimates the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of each group. Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that HDDC outperforms existing methods for clustering high-dimensional data. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Increasingly, chemical libraries are being produced which are focused on a biological target or group of related targets, rather than simply being constructed in a combinatorial fashion. A screening collection compiled from such libraries will contain multiple analogues of a number of discrete series of compounds. The question arises as to how many analogues are necessary to represent each series in order to ensure that an active series will be identified. Based on a simple probabilistic argument and supported by in-house screening data, guidelines are given for the number of compounds necessary to achieve a "hit", or series of hits, at various levels of certainty. Obtaining more than one hit from the same series is useful since this gives early acquisition of SAR (structure-activity relationship) and confirms a hit is not a singleton. We show that screening collections composed of only small numbers of analogues of each series are sub-optimal for SAR acquisition. Based on these studies, we recommend a minimum series size of about 200 compounds. This gives a high probability of confirmatory SAR (i.e. at least two hits from the same series). More substantial early SAR (at least 5 hits from the same series) can be gained by using series of about 650 compounds each. With this level of information being generated, more accurate assessment of the likely success of the series in hit-to-lead and later stage development becomes possible.},

abstract = {Methods to measure the sequence diversity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA lack standards for use as assay calibrators and controls. Here we present a general and economical method for developing customizable DNA standards of known sequence diversity. Standards ranging from 1 to 25,000 sequences were generated by directional ligation of oligonucleotide "words" of standard length and GC content and then amplified by PCR. The sequence accuracy and diversity of the library were validated using AmpliCot analysis (DNA hybridization kinetics) and Illumina sequencing. The library has the following features: (i) pools containing tens of thousands of sequences can be generated from the ligation of relatively few commercially synthesized short oligonucleotides; (ii) each sequence differs from all others in the library at a minimum of three nucleotide positions, permitting discrimination between different sequences by either sequencing or hybridization; (iii) all sequences have identical length, GC content, and melting temperature; (iv) the identity of each standard can be verified by restriction digestion; and (v) once made, the ends of the library may be cleaved and replaced with sequences to match any PCR primer pair. These standards should greatly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of sequence diversity measurements. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lipinski and others, through concepts such as drug-likeness, re-focussed drug discovery back to the principles of medicinal chemistry in the high-throughput era as key to reducing attrition. More recently, the need to go further in defining what makes a good lead has been recognised with the concept of leadlikeness. Leadlikeness implies cut-off values in the physico-chemical profile of chemical libraries such that they have reduced complexity (e.g. MW below <400) and other more restricted properties. We examine these concepts in the context of Virtual (theoretically possible), Tangible (chemically feasible) and Real (physically available) worlds of molecules. In a thought experiment, we take the HTS concept to the extreme: screening an estimated 60 million 'Global Collection' on 5000 targets and realising that perhaps millions of drug candidates might be found that could not possibly be handled in reality. Sampling of the Virtual and Tangible worlds is therefore a necessity. We show that the world of Reals is significantly under-sampled as the MW of compounds increases. This supports the design and screening of 'reduced complexity' (leadlike) compound libraries, preferably with synthetic handles available for rapid chemical iteration and detected as interesting by careful screening or biophysical assays.},

From this model we derive the optimal screening collection make up for a given fixed size of screening collection, and identify the conditions under which a diverse collection of compounds or a collection focusing on particular regions of chemical space are appropriate strategies. We derive from the model a diversity function that may be used to assess compounds for acquisition or libraries for combinatorial synthesis by their ability to complement an existing screening collection. The diversity function is linked directly through the model to the goal of more frequent discovery of lead series from high-throughput screening. We show how the model may also be used to derive relationships between collection size and probabilities of lead discovery in high-throughput screening, and to guide the judicious application of structural filters.},

abstract = {In recent years, many partitional clustering algorithms based on genetic algorithms (GA) have been proposed to tackle the problem of finding the optimal partition of a data set. Surprisingly, very few studies considered alternative stochastic search heuristics other than GAs or simulated annealing. Two promising algorithms for numerical optimization, which are hardly known outside the heuristic search field, are particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). In this study, we compared the performance of GAs with PSO and DE for a medoid evolution approach to clustering. Moreover, we compared these results with the nominal classification, k-means and random search (RS) as a lower bound. Our results show that DE is clearly and consistently superior compared to GAs and PSO for hard clustering problems, both in respect to precision as well as robustness (reproducibility) of the results. Only for trivial problems all algorithms can obtain comparable results. Apart from superior performance, DE is very easy to implement and requires hardly any parameter tuning compared to substantial tuning for GAs and PSOs. Our study shows that DE rather than GAs should receive primary attention in partitional cluster algorithms.},

Numerous subspace and projected clustering techniques have been proposed in the literature. A comprehensive evaluation of their advantages and disadvantages is urgently needed. In this paper, we evaluate systematically state-of-the-art subspace and projected clustering techniques under a wide range of experimental settings. We discuss the observed performance of the compared techniques, and we make recommendations regarding what type of techniques are suitable for what kind of problems.},

This paper discusses the weighting of fragments on the basis of their frequencies of occurrence in molecules. Extensive experiments with sets of active molecules from the MDL Drug Data Report and the World of Molecular Bioactivity databases, using fingerprints encoding Tripos holograms, Pipeline Pilot ECFC\_4 circular substructures and Sunset Molecular keys, demonstrate clearly that frequency-based screening is generally more effective than conventional, unweighted screening. The results suggest that standardising the raw occurrence frequencies by taking the square root of the frequencies will maximise the effectiveness of virtual screening. An upper-bound analysis shows the complex interactions that can take place between representations, weighting schemes and similarity coefficients when similarity measures are computed, and provides a rationalisation of the relative performance of the various weighting schemes.},

abstract = {Genetically engineered whole cells as biosensing systems in biosensors have been employed, in the past two decades, for the detection of a variety of analytes. In addition to being rapid, specific/selective, and sensitive, these whole-cell-based sensing systems provide information pertaining to the analyte bioavailability. This information is particularly important to study the effect of harmful/toxic chemicals on living systems. The whole cells used for designing and developing cell-based sensing systems can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic in nature. These intact prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells can be genetically engineered to recognize the analytes of interest and respond with the production of a measurable signal in a dose-dependent manner. Generally, prokaryotic bacterial whole-cell sensing systems are developed by introducing a plasmid construct with a reporter gene fused to a promoter, which is induced by a target analyte through a regulatory protein. Similarly, a receptor, which is activated by a target analyte, is coupled with a reporter gene for the development of genetically modified eukaryotic cell-based biosensing systems. The most commonly used reporter proteins in whole-cell biosensing include luminescent proteins, such as bacterial and firefly luciferases; green fluorescent protein along with its variants; and $\beta$-galactosidase. The analytes that can be detected using genetically manipulated whole-cell sensing systems range from general toxicants and cell stress factors to specific analytes, such as metals, metalloids, organic pollutants, sugars, drugs, and bacterial signaling molecules. In order to develop self-contained sensing devices based on recombinant whole-cell sensing systems, preservation, miniaturization, and portability are important issues that need to be addressed.},

abstract = {A rapid development in diverse areas of molecular biology and genetic engineering resulted in emergence of variety of tools. These tools are not only applicable to basic researches being carried out world over, but also exploited for precise detection of abnormal conditions in plants, animals and human body. Although a basic researcher is well versed with few techniques used by him/her in the laboratory, they may not be well acquainted with methodologies, which can be used to work out some of their own research problems.The picture is more blurred when the molecular diagnostic tools are to be used by physicians, scientists and technicians working in diagnostic laboratories in hospitals, industry and academic institutions. Since many of them are not trained in basics of these methods, they come across several gray areas in understanding of these tools. The accurate application of molecular diagnostic tools demands in depth understanding of the methodology for precise detection of the abnormal condition of living body.To meet the requirements of a good book on molecular diagnostics of students, physicians, scientists working in agricultural, veterinary, medical and pharmaceutical sciences, it needs to expose the reader lucidly to:Give basic science behind commonly used tools in diagnosticsExpose the readers to detailed applications of these tools andMake them aware the availability of such diagnostic toolsThe book will attract additional audience of pathologists, medical microbiologists, pharmaceutical sciences, agricultural scientists and veterinary doctors if the following topics are incorporated at appropriate places in Unit II or separately as a part of Unit-III in the book.Molecular diagnosis of diseases in agricultural cropsMolecular diagnosis of veterinary diseases.Molecular epidemiology, which helps to differentiate various epidemic strains and sources of disease outbreaks. Even in different units of the same hospital, the infections could be by different strains of the same species and the information becomes valuable for infection control strategies.Drug resistance is a growing problem for bacterial, fungal and parasitic microbes and the molecular biology tools can help to detect the drug resistance genes without the cultivation and in vitro sensitivity testing. Molecular diagnostics offers faster help in the selection of the proper antibiotic for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is a major problem of the in the developing world. The conventional culture and drug sensitivity testing of tuberculosis bacilli is laborious and time consuming, whereas molecular diagnosis offers rapid drug resistant gene detection even from direct clinical samples. The same approach for HIV, malaria and many more diseases needs to be considered.Molecular diagnostics in the detection of diseases during foetal life is an upcoming area in the foetal medicine in case of genetic abnormalities and infectious like TORCH complex etc.The book will be equally useful to students, scientists and professionals working in the field of molecular diagnostics.},

abstract = {Recent literature has demonstrated the applicability of genetic programming to induction of decision trees for modelling toxicity endpoints. Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

Aim: To highlight the data quality issues present in these data sets, and the problems that can arise when they are used in a binary classification context. Method: A thorough exploration of all 13 original NASA data sets, followed by various experiments demonstrating the potential impact of duplicate data points when data mining. Conclusions: Firstly researchers need to analyse the data that forms the basis of their findings in the context of how it will be used. Secondly, the bulk of defect prediction experiments based on the NASA MDP data sets may have led to erroneous findings. This is mainly because of repeated/duplicate data points potentially causing substantial amounts of training and testing data to be identical.},

The database and online resource STRING generalizes access to protein interaction data, by integrating known and predicted interactions from a variety of sources. The underlying infrastructure includes a consistent body of completely sequenced genomes and exhaustive orthology classifications, based on which interaction evidence is transferred between organisms. Although primarily developed for protein interaction analysis, the resource has also been successfully applied to comparative genomics, phylogenetics and network studies, which are all facilitated by programmatic access to the database backend and the availability of compact download files. As of release 7, STRING has almost doubled to 373 distinct organisms, and contains more than 1.5 million proteins for which associations have been pre-computed. Novel features include AJAX-based web-navigation, inclusion of additional resources such as BioGRID, and detailed protein domain annotation. STRING is available at http://string.embl.de/},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recognizing regulatory sequences in genomes is a continuing challenge, despite a wealth of available genomic data and a growing number of experimentally validated examples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We discuss here a simple approach to search for regulatory sequences based on the compositional similarity of genomic regions and known cis-regulatory sequences. This method, which is not limited to searching for predefined motifs, recovers sequences known to be under similar regulatory control. The words shared by the recovered sequences often correspond to known binding sites. Furthermore, we show that although local word profile clustering is predictive for the regulatory sequences involved in blastoderm segmentation, local dissimilarity is a more universal feature of known regulatory sequences in Drosophila. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our method leverages sequence motifs within a known regulatory sequence to identify co-regulated sequences without explicitly defining binding sites. We also show that regulatory sequences can be distinguished from surrounding sequences by local sequence dissimilarity, a novel feature in identifying regulatory sequences across a genome.

abstract = {By generating a large diversity of molecules, the immune system selects antibodies that bind antigens. Sharing the same approach, combinatorial biotechnologies use a large library of compounds to screen for molecules of high affinity to a given target. Understanding the properties of the best binders in the pool aids the design of the library. In particular, how does the maximum affinity increase with the size of the library or repertoire? We consider two alternative models to examine the properties of extreme affinities. In the first model, affinities are distributed lognormally, while in the second, affinities are determined by the number of matches to a target sequence. The second model more explicitly models nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) and proteins such as antibodies. Using extreme value theory we show that the logarithm of the mean of the highest affinity in a combinatorial library grows linearly with the square root of the log of the library size. When there is an upper bound to affinity, this "absolute maximum" is also approached approximately linearly with root log library size, reaching the upper limit abruptly. The design of libraries may benefit from considering how this plateau is reached as the library size is increased. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that the total cost of employing joint replenishment for correlated items is less than the total cost of using single-item replenishment. Savings increase dramatically when the demand between items is closely related. Although the benefits of joint replenishment are significant, it is difficult to define the demand correlation among items, especially when the number of items increases. A large number of items reduces the efficiency and advantage of the multi-item inventory control. To overcome this difficulty, an association clustering algorithm this paper proposes to evaluate the correlated demands among items. The proposed algorithm utilizes the "support" concept in association rule analysis to measure the similarity among items. Based on these measurements a clustering method is developed to group items with close demand in a hierarchal way. The can-order policy is then applied to the optimal clustering result as decided by the proposed performance index. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed association clustering algorithm for replenishment systems, a set of simulations and a sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results of the experiments show that the proposed method outperforms several replenishment models. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It has reportedly outperformed a few evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and other search heuristics like the particle swarm optimization (PSO) when tested over both benchmark and real-world problems. DE, however, is not completely free from the problems of slow and/or premature convergence. This paper describes a family of improved variants of the DE/target-to-best/1/bin scheme, which utilizes the concept of the neighborhood of each population member. The idea of small neighborhoods, defined over the index-graph of parameter vectors, draws inspiration from the community of the PSO algorithms. The proposed schemes balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of DE without imposing serious additional burdens in terms of function evaluations. They are shown to be statistically significantly better than or at least comparable to several existing DE variants as well as a few other significant evolutionary computing techniques over a test suite of 24 benchmark functions. The paper also investigates the applications of the new DE variants to two real-life problems concerning parameter estimation for frequency modulated sound waves and spread spectrum radar poly-phase code design.},

abstract = {In recent years, some spectral feature selec- tion methods are proposed to choose those features with high power of preserving sam- ple similarity. However, when there exist lots of irrelevant or noisy features in data, the similarity matrix constructed from all the un-weighted features may be not reli- able, which then misleads existing spectral feature selection methods to select ’wrong’ features. To solve this problem, we pro- pose that feature importance should be eval- uated according to their impacts on similar- ity matrix, which means features with high impacts on similarity matrix should be cho- sen as important ones. Since graph Lapla- cian(Luxburg, 2007) is defined on the simi- larity matrix, then the impact of each feature on similarity matrix can be reflected on the change of graph Laplacian, especially on its eigen-system. Based on this point of view, we propose an Eigenvalue Sensitive Crite- ria (EVSC) for feature selection, which aims at seeking those features with high impact on graph Laplacian’s eigenvalues. Empirical analysis demonstrates our proposed method outperforms some traditional spectral feature selection methods. 1.},

abstract = {Many experiments require a fast and cost-effective method to monitor nucleic acid sequence diversity. Here we describe a method called diversity visualization by endonuclease (DiVE) that allows rapid visualization of sequence diversity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products based on DNA hybridization kinetics coupled with the activity of a single-strand specific nuclease. The assay involves only a limited number of steps and can be performed in less than 4 h, including the initial PCR. After PCR, the homoduplex double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is denatured and reannealed under stringent conditions. During the reannealing process, incubation with S1 nuclease removes single-stranded loops of formed heteroduplexes and the resulting digest is visualized on agarose gel. The sequence diversity is inversely proportional to the band intensities of S1 nuclease surviving dsDNA molecules of expected size. As an example, we employed DiVE to monitor the diversity of panning rounds from a single-framework, semisynthetic single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library. The results are in good agreement with the observed decrease in diversity in phage display panning rounds toward the selection of monoclonal scFv. We conclude that the DiVE assay allows rapid and cost-effective monitoring of diversities of various nucleotide libraries and proves to be particularly suitable for scaffold-based randomized libraries. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The problem of finding association rules in a large data- base of sales transactions has been widely studied in the literature, We discuss some of the weaknesses of the large itemset method for association rule generation. A differ- ent method for evaluating and finding itemsets referred to as otrongIyl collective itemsets is proposed. The concepts of “support” of an itemset and correlation of the items within an itemset are related, though not quite the same. This cri- terion stresses the importance of the actual correlation of the items with one another rather than the absolute sup- port, Previously proposed methods to provide correlated itemsets are not necessarily applicable to very large data- bases, We provide an algorithm which provides very good computational efficiency, while maintaining statistical ro- buetneas, The fact that this algorithm relies on relative measures rather than absolute measures such as support also implies that the method can be applied to find association rules in datasets in which items may appear in a sizeable percentage of the transactions (dense datasets), datasets in which the items have varying density, or even negative as- sociation rules,},

The evolution of the sciences and technologies that have evolved as the foundation of modern HTS campaigns are complex and require multidisciplinary interactions. Innovations in integrated automated systems, reagent systems enabled by molecular biology, computational capabilities, and visualization tools have converged to provide sophisticated tools to HTS practitioners. The success of HTS in an organi- zation does not rest solely with those performing HTS but is critically dependent on the interactions of biology and chemistry members of the multidisciplinary teams throughout the early discovery process. Thus a basic knowledge and understanding of the components and processes of HTS is a necessary requirement for effective communication in planning, executing, and analyzing an HTS campaign. This chapter addresses the key components of HTS campaigns, common approaches, and related issues that should be understood by those engaged in small molecule drug discovery.},

abstract = {The Internet has provided IS researchers with the opportunity to conduct studies with extremely large sam- ples, frequently well over 10,000 observations. There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the p-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, p-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on p-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low p-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the p-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay. We believe that addressing the p-value problem will increase the credibility of large sample IS research as well as provide more insights for readers.},

abstract = {Reliable effort estimation remains an ongoing challenge to software engineers. Accurate effort estimation is the state of art of software engineering, effort estimation of software is the preliminary phase between the client and the business enterprise. The relationship between the client and the business enterprise begins with the estimation of the software. The credibility of the client to the business enterprise increases with the accurate estimation. Effort estimation often requires generalizing from a small number of historical projects. Generalization from such limited experience is an inherently under constrained problem. Accurate estimation is a complex process because it can be visualized as software effort prediction, as the term indicates prediction never becomes an actual. This work follows the basics of the empirical software effort estimation models. The goal of this paper is to study the empirical software effort estimation. The primary conclusion is that no single technique is best for all situations, and that a careful comparison of the results of several approaches is most likely to produce realistic estimates.},

researchers recognize that comprehensibility is an important condition
for the use, and therefore usefulness, of knowledge discovery methods.
An investigation of the comprehensibility of the discovered patterns may
benefit IS research as well. This paper identifies some of the issues
that such inquiry may face. Related findings and conclusions of four
case studies focusing on applications of decision tree induction
methods, are described. A discussion based on these studies suggests,
among the rest, that the problem of comprehensibility is complicated by
a complex context due to a diversity of problem domain attributes, user
and task characteristics, algorithmic methods, and concurrency of user
goals. Solutions to problems of discovered patterns that are not easy to
interpret and validate may involve integration of available information
technologies, and utilization of multiple information types and sources.
An investigation of comprehensibility issues may benefit from the
adoption of multiple definitions in relation to this concept},

abstract = {Large media collections rapidly evolve in the World Wide Web. In addition to the targeted retrieval as is performed by search engines, browsing and explorative navigation is an important issue. Since the collections grow fast and authors most often do not annotate their web pages according to a given ontology, automatic structuring is in demand as a prerequisite for any pleasant human-computer interface. In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding alternative high-quality structures for navigation in a large collection of high-dimensional data. We express desired properties of frequent termset clustering \{(FTS)\} in terms of objective functions. In general, these functions are conflicting. This leads to the formulation of \{FTS\} clustering as a multi-objective optimization problem. The optimization is solved by a genetic algorithm. The result is a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Users may choose their favorite type of a structure for their navigation through a collection or explore the different views given by the different optimal solutions. We explore the capability of the new approach to produce structures that are well suited for browsing on a social bookmarking data set.},

abstract = {Bug localization is the task of determining which source code$\backslash$nentities are relevant to a bug report. Manual bug localization is labor$\backslash$nintensive since developers must consider thousands of source code$\backslash$nentities. Current research builds bug localization classifiers, based on$\backslash$ninformation retrieval models, to locate entities that are textually$\backslash$nsimilar to the bug report. Current research, however, does not consider$\backslash$nthe effect of classifier configuration, i.e., all the parameter values$\backslash$nthat specify the behavior of a classifier. As such, the effect of each$\backslash$nparameter or which parameter values lead to the best performance is$\backslash$nunknown. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effectiveness of$\backslash$na large space of classifier configurations, 3,172 in total. Further, we$\backslash$nintroduce a framework for combining the results of multiple classifier$\backslash$nconfigurations since classifier combination has shown promise in other$\backslash$ndomains. Through a detailed case study on over 8,000 bug reports from$\backslash$nthree large-scale projects, we make two main contributions. First, we$\backslash$nshow that the parameters of a classifier have a significant impact on$\backslash$nits performance. Second, we show that combining multiple$\backslash$nclassifiers--whether those classifiers are hand-picked or randomly$\backslash$nchosen relative to intelligently defined subspaces of$\backslash$nclassifiers--improves the performance of even the best individual$\backslash$nclassifiers.},

abstract = {Information systems portfolio management assumes that software will evolve to maintain alignment with operational needs, a goal that must be met through effective ongoing maintenance. Thus, a primary goal of software maintainers is to ensure that production code is updated without the introduction of defects. However, there is a dearth of research that examines the work product defects that occur as these applications evolve. The goal of this study is to characterize software evolution lifecycle work product defects and factors that may increase or reduce their occurrence. The study takes place within a global consulting organization conducting ongoing software maintenance for a Fortune 100 telecommunications firm by a project team assessed at Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3. This study reports on 961 work product reviews conducted across the evolution activities of the ISO/IEC 12207 Software Development Life Cycle Processes. After controlling for team and expertise differences, the study's major finding is that corrective evolution projects inject a greater number of work product defects than enhancive evolution projects. This result does not arise from the schedule compression often associated with corrective evolution. Rather, it is concluded that the increase in work product defects is associated with the increased complexity of analysis-stage problem diagnosis found in corrective evolution projects. The analysis is augmented by additional covariates including the number of work product reviewers, preparation time of reviewers, and size of the project.},

@article{Deb2005a,
abstract = {Since the suggestion of a computing procedure of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions in multi-objective optimization problems in the early Nineties, researchers have been on the look out for a procedure which is computationally fast and simultaneously capable of finding a well-converged and well-distributed set of solutions. Most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) developed in the past decade are either good for achieving a well-distributed solutions at the expense of a large computational effort or computationally fast at the expense of achieving a not-so-good distribution of solutions. For example, although the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm or SPEA (Zitzler and Thiele, 1999) produces a much better distribution compared to the elitist non-dominated sorting GA or NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002a), the computational time needed to run SPEA is much greater. In this paper, we evaluate a recently-proposed steady-state MOEA (Deb et al., 2003) which was developed based on the epsilon-dominance concept introduced earlier(Laumanns et al., 2002) and using efficient parent and archive update strategies for achieving a well-distributed and well-converged set of solutions quickly. Based on an extensive comparative study with four other state-of-the-art MOEAs on a number of two, three, and four objective test problems, it is observed that the steady-state MOEA is a good compromise in terms of convergence near to the Pareto-optimal front, diversity of solutions, and computational time. Moreover, the epsilon-MOEA is a step closer towards making MOEAs pragmatic, particularly allowing a decision-maker to control the achievable accuracy in the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions.},

abstract = {Intense interest in knowledge-acquisition research began 25 years ago, stimulated by the excitement about knowledge-based systems that emerged in the 1970s followed by the realities of the AI Winter that arrived in the 1980s. The knowledge-acquisition workshops that responded to this interest led to the formation of a vibrant research community that has achieved remarkable consensus on a number of issues. These viewpoints include (1) the rejection of the notion of knowledge as a commodity to be transferred from one locus to another, (2) an acceptance of the situated nature of human expertise, (3) emphasis on knowledge acquisition as the modeling of problem solving, and (4) the pursuit of reusable patterns in problem solving and in domain descriptions that can facilitate both modeling and system implementation. The Semantic Web community will benefit greatly by incorporating these perspectives in its work. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it. Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general-all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains: Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset Search engine features-crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in adataset Evolving intelligence for problem solving-how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful. Go beyond simple database-backed applications and put the wealth of Internet data to work for you. "Bravo! I cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods, nor can I think of a better way for me (an old AI dog) to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details." - Dan Russell, Google "Toby's book does a great job of breaking down the complex subject matter of machine-learning algorithms into practical, easy-to-understand examples that can be directly applied to analysis of social interaction across the Web today.

The observed relationships were compared with those predicted by Lawrence Putnam's Rayleigh curve model and Barry Boehm's COCOMO model. The results suggested that although the form of the basic empirical relationships were consistent with the cost models, the COCOMO model was a poor estimator of cost for the current data set and the data did not follow the Rayleigh curve suggested by Putnam. However, the results did suggest that it was possible to develop cost models tailored to a particular environment and to improve the precision of the models as they are used during the development cycle by including additional information such as the known effort for the early development phases. The paper finishes by discussing some of the problems involved in developing useful cost models.},

abstract = {Software systems are designed and engineered to process data. However, software is data too. The size and variety of today's software artifacts and the multitude of stakeholder activities result in so much data that individuals can no longer reason about all of it. Software evolution is no longer just about writing code, it is becoming an information management problem.
Analysis and management of the software data are activities that software engineers are not trained to do. We have to look for solutions outside software engineering, adopt them, and make them our own. These solutions can come from data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, statistical analysis, etc. This is not the first time software engineers are looking at such solutions. It has been going on for about two decades, in a form or another. The results so far indicate that software engineering is facing a paradigm shift, where more and more software engineering tasks are reinterpreted as optimization, search, retrieval, or classification problems. Despite this experience, applications of data analysis, data integration, and data mining in software engineering are in their infancy by comparison with other research fields. New research is needed to adapt existing algorithms and tools for software engineering data and processes, and new ones will have to be created. This research has to be supported by integration with software development processes and with education as well. More than that, in order for this type of research to succeed, it should be supported with new approaches to empirical work, where data and results are shared globally among researchers and practitioners.
The talk will focus on arguing for and mapping out (part of) this research agenda, while looking back at (some of) the existing work in the area.},

abstract = {Genomic datasets often consist of large, binary, sparse data matrices. In such a dataset, one is often interested in finding contiguous blocks that (mostly) contain ones. This is a biclustering problem, and while many algorithms have been proposed to deal with gene expression data, only two algorithms have been proposed that specifically deal with binary matrices. None of the gene expression biclustering algorithms can handle the large number of zeros in sparse binary matrices. The two proposed binary algorithms failed to produce meaningful results. In this article, we present a new algorithm that is able to extract biclusters from sparse, binary datasets. A powerful feature is that biclusters with different numbers of rows and columns can be detected, varying from many rows to few columns and few rows to many columns. It allows the user to guide the search towards biclusters of specific dimensions. When applying our algorithm to an input matrix derived from TRANSFAC, we find transcription factors with distinctly dissimilar binding motifs, but a clear set of common targets that are significantly enriched for GO categories.},

abstract = {Context: Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system. In order to improve estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based SDEE models (ML models) since 1990s. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Objective: This research aims to systematically analyze ML models from four aspects: type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context. Method: We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ML model published in the last two decades (1991-2010). Results: We have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research. After investigating these studies, we found that eight types of ML techniques have been employed in SDEE models. Overall speaking, the estimation accuracy of these ML models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non-ML models. Furthermore, different ML models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts. Conclusion: ML models are promising in the field of SDEE. However, the application of ML models in industry is still limited, so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ML models. To this end, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The fields of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.},

abstract = {Most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective
optimisation maintain a population of solutions from which individuals
are selected for reproduction. In this paper, we introduce a simpler
evolution scheme for multiobjective problems, called the Pareto archived
evolution strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest
possible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions
in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm is identified as being a (1+1)
evolution strategy, using local search from a population of one but
using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to
identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate
solution vectors. PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against
which more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in
some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or
competitive with population-based methods. The performance of the new
algorithm is compared with that of a MOEA based on the niched Pareto GA
on a real world application from the telecommunications field. In
addition, we include results from experiments carried out on a suite of
four test functions, to demonstrate the algorithm's general capability

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C. Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba, the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but as the examples are self-contained, the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

abstract = {Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval.},

abstract = {This paper gives a survey of contrast set mining (CSM), emerging pattern mining (EPM), and subgroup
discovery (SD) in a unifying framework named supervised descriptive rule discovery. While
all these research areas aim at discovering patterns in the form of rules induced from labeled data,
they use different terminology and task definitions, claim to have different goals, claim to use different
rule learning heuristics, and use different means for selecting subsets of induced patterns.
This paper contributes a novel understanding of these subareas of data mining by presenting a unified
terminology, by explaining the apparent differences between the learning tasks as variants of
a unique supervised descriptive rule discovery task and by exploring the apparent differences between
the approaches. It also shows that various rule learning heuristics used in CSM, EPMand SD
algorithms all aim at optimizing a trade off between rule coverage and precision. The commonalities
(and differences) between the approaches are showcased on a selection of best known variants
of CSM, EPM and SD algorithms. The paper also provides a critical survey of existing supervised
descriptive rule discovery visualization methods.},

With the categorizing framework, we continue our efforts toward building an integrated system for intelligent feature selection. A unifying platform is proposed as an intermediate step. An illustrative example is presented to show how existing feature selection algorithms can be integrated into a meta algorithm that can take advantage of individual algorithms. An added advantage of doing so is to help a user employ a suitable algorithm without knowing details of each algorithm. Some real-world applications are included to demonstrate the use of feature selection in data mining. We conclude this work by identifying trends and challenges of feature selection research and development.},

abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) has emerged as one of the fast, robust, and efficient global search heuristics of current interest. This paper describes an application of DE to the automatic clustering of large unlabeled data sets. In contrast to most of the existing clustering techniques, the proposed algorithm requires no prior knowledge of the data to be classified. Rather, it determines the optimal number of partitions of the data "on the run." Superiority of the new method is demonstrated by comparing it with two recently developed partitional clustering techniques and one popular hierarchical clustering algorithm. The partitional clustering algorithms are based on two powerful well-known optimization algorithms, namely the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization. An interesting real-world application of the proposed method to automatic segmentation of images is also reported.},

abstract = {The structure of a software system has a major impact on its maintainability. To improve maintainability, software systems are usually organized into subsystems using the constructs of packages or modules. However, during software evolution the structure of the system undergoes continuous modifications, drifting away from its original design, often reducing its quality. In this paper we propose an approach for helping maintainers to improve the quality of software modularization. The proposed approach analyzes the (structural and semantic) relationships between classes in a package identifying chains of strongly related classes. The identified chains are used to define new packages with higher cohesion than the original package. The proposed approach has been empirical evaluated through a case study. The context of the study is represented by an open source system, JHotDraw, and two software systems developed by teams of students at the University of Salerno. The analysis of the results reveals that the proposed approach generates meaningful re-modularization of the studied systems, which can lead to higher quality.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new approach for clustering—pattern preserving clustering—which produces more easily interpretable and usable clusters. This approach is motivated by the following observation: while there are usually strong patterns in the data—patterns that may be key for the analysis and description of the data—these patterns are often split among different clusters by current clustering approaches. This is, perhaps, not surprising, since clustering algorithms have no built-in knowledge of these patterns and may often have goals that are in conflict with preserving patterns, e.g., minimize the distance of points to their nearest cluster centroids. In this paper, our focus is to characterize (1) the benefits of pattern preserving clustering and (2) the most effective way of performing pattern preserving clustering. To that end, we propose and evaluate two clustering algorithms, HIerarchical Clustering with pAttern Preservation (HICAP) and bisecting K-means Clustering with pAttern Preservation (K-CAP). Experimental results on document data show that HICAP can produce overlapping clusters that preserve useful patterns, but has relatively worse clustering performance than bisecting K-means with respect to the clustering evaluation criterion of entropy. By contrast, in terms of entropy, K-CAP can perform substantially better than the bisecting K-means algorithm when data sets contain clusters of widely different sizes—a common situation in the real-world. Most importantly, we also illustrate how patterns, if preserved, can aid cluster interpretation.

In the context of software change, concept location means finding locations in source code where changes are to be made in response to a modification request. Static techniques for concept location usually rely on searching the source code using textual information or on navigating the dependencies among software elements. In this paper we propose a novel static concept location technique, which leverages both the textual information present in the code and the structural dependencies between source code elements. The technique employs a textual search in that source code, which is clustered using the Border Flow algorithm, based on combining both structural and textual data. We evaluated the technique against a text search based baseline approach using data on almost 200 changes from five software systems. The results indicate that the new approach outperforms the baseline and that improvements are still possible.},

abstract = {To meet critical business challenges, software development teams need data to effectively manage product quality, cost, and schedule. The Team Software ProcessSM (TSPSM) provides a framework that teams use to collect software process data in real time, using a defined disciplined process. This data holds promise for use in software engineering research. We combined data from 109 industrial projects into a database to support performance benchmarking and model development. But is the data of sufficient quality to draw conclusions? We applied various tests and techniques to identify data anomalies that affect the quality of the data in several dimensions. In this paper, we report some initial results of our analysis, describing the amount and the rates of identified anomalies and suspect data, including incorrectness, inconsistency, and credibility. To illustrate the types of data available for analysis, we provide three examples. The preliminary results of this empirical study suggest that some aspects of the data quality are good and the data are generally credible, but size data are often missing},

@article{Schuffenhauer2006a,
abstract = {Following the theoretical model by Hann et al. moderately complex structures are preferable lead compounds since they lead to specific binding events involving the complete ligand molecule. To make this concept usable in practice for library design, we studied several complexity measures on the biological activity of ligand molecules. We applied the historical IC50/EC50 summary data of 160 assays run at Novartis covering a diverse range of targets, among them kinases, proteases, GPCRs, and protein-protein interactions, and compared this to the background of "inactive" compounds which have been screened for 2 years but have never shown any activity in any primary screen. As complexity measures we used the number of structural features present in various molecular fingerprints and descriptors. We found generally that with increasing activity of the ligands, their average complexity also increased, and we could therefore establish a minimum number of structural features in each descriptor needed for biological activity. Especially well suited in this context were the Similog keys and circular substructure fingerprints. These are those descriptors, which also perform especially well in the identification of bioactive compounds by similarity search, suggesting that structural features encoded in these descriptors have a high relevance for bioactivity. Since the number of features correlates with the number of atoms present in the molecule, also the number of atoms serves as a reasonable complexity measure and larger molecules have, in general, higher activities. Due to the relationship between feature counts and densities on one hand and biological activity on the other, the size bias present in almost all similarity coefficients becomes especially important. Diversity selections using these coefficients can influence the overall complexity of the resulting set of molecules, which has an impact on the biological activity that they exhibit. Using sphere-exclusion based diversity selection methods, such as OptiSim together with the Tanimoto dissimilarity, the average feature count distribution of the resulting selections is shifted toward lower complexity than that of the original set, particularly when applying tight diversity constraints. This size bias reduces the fraction of molecules in the subsets having the complexity required for a high, submicromolar activity. None of the diversity selection methods studied, namely OptiSim, divisive K-means clustering, and self-organizing maps, yielded subsets covering the activity space of the IC50 summary data set better than subsets selected randomly.},

abstract = {A predictive model is required to be accurate and comprehensible in order to inspire confidence in a business setting. Both aspects have been assessed in a software effort estimation setting by previous studies. However, no univocal conclusion as to which technique is the most suited has been reached. This study addresses this issue by reporting on the results of a large scale benchmarking study. Different types of techniques are under consideration, including techniques inducing tree/rule based models like M5 and CART, linear models such as various types of linear regression, nonlinear models (MARS, multilayered perceptron neural networks, radial basis function networks, and least squares support vector machines), and estimation techniques that do not explicitly induce a model (e.g., a case-based reasoning approach). Furthermore, the aspect of feature subset selection by using a generic backward input selection wrapper is investigated. The results are subjected to rigorous statistical testing and indicate that ordinary least squares regression in combination with a logarithmic transformation performs best. Another key finding is that by selecting a subset of highly predictive attributes such as project size, development, and environment related attributes, typically a significant increase in estimation accuracy can be obtained.},

abstract = {There are more than twenty distinct software engineering tasks addressed with text retrieval (TR) techniques, such as, traceability link recovery, feature location, refactoring, reuse, etc. A common issue with all TR applications is that the results of the retrieval depend largely on the quality of the query. When a query performs poorly, it has to be reformulated and this is a difficult task for someone who had trouble writing a good query in the first place. We propose a recommender (called Refoqus) based on machine learning, which is trained with a sample of queries and relevant results. Then, for a given query, it automatically recommends a reformulation strategy that should improve its performance, based on the properties of the query. We evaluated Refoqus empirically against four baseline approaches that are used in natural language document retrieval. The data used for the evaluation corresponds to changes from five open source systems in Java and C++ and it is used in the context of TR-based concept location in source code. Refoqus outperformed the baselines and its recommendations lead to query performance improvement or preservation in 84\% of the cases (in average).},

abstract = {Clustering is the problem of identifying the distribution of patterns and intrinsic correlations in large data sets by partitioning the data points into similarity classes. This paper studies the problem of clustering binary data. This is the case for market basket datasets where the transactions contain items and for document datasets where the documents contain “bag of words”. The contribution of the paper is three-fold. First a general binary data clustering model is presented. The model treats the data and features equally, based on their symmetric association relations, and explicitly describes the data assignments as well as feature assignments. We character- ize several variations with different optimization procedures for the general model. Second, we also establish the connections between our clustering model with other existing clustering methods. Third, we also discuss the problem for determining the number of clusters for binary clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering model.},

abstract = {SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) is an experimental procedure that allows the extraction, from an initially random pool of DNA, of those oligomers with high affinity for a given DNA-binding protein. We address what is a suitable experimental and computational procedure to infer parameters of transcription factor-DNA interaction from SELEX experiments. To answer this, we use a biophysical model of transcription factor-DNA interactions to quantitatively model SELEX. We show that a standard procedure is unsuitable for obtaining accurate interaction parameters. However, we theoretically show that a modified experiment in which chemical potential is fixed through different rounds of the experiment allows robust generation of an appropriate dataset. Based on our quantitative model, we propose a novel bioinformatic method of data analysis for such a modified experiment and apply it to extract the interaction parameters for a mammalian transcription factor CTF/NFI. From a practical point of view, our method results in a significantly improved false positive/false negative trade-off, as compared to both the standard information theory based method and a widely used empirically formulated procedure.},

abstract = {Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is the predominant linear dimensionality reduction technique, and has been widely applied on datasets in all scientific domains. We consider, both theoretically and empirically, the topic of unsupervised feature selection for PCA, by leveraging algorithms for the so-called Column Subset Selection Problem (CSSP). In words, the CSSP seeks the "best" subset of exactly k columns from an m x n data matrix A, and has been extensively studied in the Numerical Linear Algebra community. We present a novel two-stage algorithm for the CSSP. From a theoretical perspective, for small to moderate values of k, this algorithm significantly improves upon the best previously-existing results 24, 12 for the CSSP. From an empirical perspective, we evaluate this algorithm as an unsupervised feature selection strategy in three application domains of modern statistical data analysis: finance, document-term data, and genetics. We pay particular attention to how this algorithm may be used to select representative or landmark features from an object-feature matrix in an unsupervised manner. In all three application domains, we are able to identify k landmark features, i.e., columns of the data matrix, that capture nearly the same amount of information as does the subspace that is spanned by the top k "eigenfeatures."},

abstract = {Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an important technology in combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology of developing high affinity target-binding molecules (aptamers) from highly complex nucleic acid ligand libraries. Schematically, the SELEX is a series of iterative rounds of operations where in each operational round ligands are incubated with the target (e.g., a purified protein), and target-binding ligands are extracted and amplified. In the recent development of biological study and drug discovery, by incubating ligand libraries with complex target mixtures (e.g., cell fragments), the SELEX experiments have been explored to simultaneously develop aptamers for targets embedded in target mixtures: the complex SELEX. While holding the considerable advantages of saving experimental resources, practicing the complex SELEX has often accompanied with unstable experimental performances. It is therefore important to understand the behaviors of the new application. In this paper, we develop stochastic computer model, and customized computational algorithm to numerically mimic the complex SELEX. We model the ligand selection through the probability of ligand binding to complex targets at the binding equilibrium, and efficiency of separating target-binders for amplification. The customized computational algorithm allows us to simulate real experiments that operate on huge ligand libraries. We evaluate the ligand evolution, and aptamer enrichment of complex SELEX under various experimental conditions by stochastic simulations, and theorize the simulated results. We argue that the stochastic effects, which were not previously captured in the studies of complex SELEX, may significantly affect the results of experiments. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Two essential aspects of virtual screening are considered: experimental design and performance metrics. In the design of any retrospective virtual screen, choices have to be made as to the purpose of the exercise. Is the goal to compare methods? Is the interest in a particular type of target or all targets? Are we simulating a ‘real-world’ setting, or teasing out distinguishing features of a method? What are the confidence limits for the results? What should be reported in a publication? In particular, what criteria should be used to decide between different performance metrics? Comparing the field of molecular modeling to other endeavors, such as medical statistics, criminology, or computer hardware evaluation indicates some clear directions. Taken together these suggest the modeling field has a long way to go to provide effective assessment of its approaches, either to itself or to a broader audience, but that there are no technical reasons why progress cannot be made.},

abstract = {Landmark multidimensional scaling (LMDS) uses a subset of data (landmark points) to solve classical multidimensional scaling (MDS), where the scalability is increased but the approximation is noise-sensitive. In this paper we present an LMDS ensemble where we use a portion of the input in a piecewise manner to solve classical MDS, combining individual LMDS solutions which operate on different partitions of the input. Ground control points (GCPs) that are shared by partitions considered in the ensemble, allow us to align individual LMDS solutions in a common coordinate system through affine transformations. We incorporate priors into combining multiple LMDS solutions such that the weighted averaging by priors improves the noise-robustness of our method. Our LMDS ensemble is much less noise-sensitive while maintaining the scalability and the speed of LMDS. Experiments on synthetic data (noisy grid) and real-world data (similar image retrieval) confirm the high performance of the proposed LMDS ensemble. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase. Science 249, 505-510] aims at the development of aptamers, which are oligonucleotides (RNA or ssDNA) binding to their target with high selectivity and sensitivity because of their three-dimensional shape. Aptamers are all new ligands with a high affinity for considerably differing molecules ranging from large targets as proteins over peptides, complex molecules to drugs and organic small molecules or even metal ions. Aptamers are widely used, including medical and pharmaceutical basic research, drug development, diagnosis, and therapy. Analytical and separation tools bearing aptamers as molecular recognition and binding elements are another big field of application. Moreover, aptamers are used for the investigation of binding phenomena in proteomics. The SELEX method was modified over the years in different ways to become more efficient and less time consuming, to reach higher affinities of the aptamers selected and for automation of the process. This review is focused on the development of aptamers by use of SELEX and gives an overview about technologies, advantages, limitations, and applications of aptamers. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Python Algorithms explains the Python approach to algorithm analysis and design. Written by Magnus Lie Hetland, author of Beginning Python, this book is sharply focused on classical algorithms, but it also gives a solid understanding of fundamental algorithmic problem-solving techniques. The book deals with some of the most important and challenging areas of programming and computer science, but in a highly pedagogic and readable manner. The book covers both algorithmic theory and programming practice, demonstrating how theory is reflected in real Python programs. Well-known algorithms and data structures that are built into the Python language are explained, and the user is shown how to implement and evaluate others himself. What you’ll learn Transform new problems to well-known algorithmic problems with efficient solutions, or show that the problems belong to classes of problems thought not to be efficiently solvable. Analyze algorithms and Python programs both using mathematical tools and basic experiments and benchmarks. Prove correctness, optimality, or bounds on approximation error for Python programs and their underlying algorithms. Understand several classical algorithms and data structures in depth, and be able to implement these efficiently in Python. Design and implement new algorithms for new problems, using time-tested design principles and techniques. Speed up implementations, using a plethora of tools for high-performance computing in Python. Who this book is for The book is intended for Python programmers who need to learn about algorithmic problem-solving, or who need a refresher. Students of computer science, or similar programming-related topics, such as bioinformatics, may also find the book to be quite useful.

abstract = {Instead of finding clusters in the full feature space, subspace clustering is an emergent task which aims at detecting clusters embedded in subspaces. Most of previous works in the literature are density-based approaches, where a cluster is regarded as a high-density region in a subspace. However, the identification of dense regions in previous works lacks of considering a critical problem, called "the density divergence problemrdquo in this paper, which refers to the phenomenon that the region densities vary in different subspace cardinalities. Without considering this problem, previous works utilize a density threshold to discover the dense regions in all subspaces, which incurs the serious loss of clustering accuracy (either recall or precision of the resulting clusters) in different subspace cardinalities. To tackle the density divergence problem, in this paper, we devise a novel subspace clustering model to discover the clusters based on the relative region densities in the subspaces, where the clusters are regarded as regions whose densities are relatively high as compared to the region densities in a subspace. Based on this idea, different density thresholds are adaptively determined to discover the clusters in different subspace cardinalities. Due to the infeasibility of applying previous techniques in this novel clustering model, we also devise an innovative algorithm, referred to as DENCOS (density conscious subspace clustering), to adopt a divide-and-conquer scheme to efficiently discover clusters satisfying different density thresholds in different subspace cardinalities. As validated by our extensive experiments on various data sets, DENCOS can discover the clusters in all subspaces with high quality, and the efficiency of DENCOS outperformes previous works.},

abstract = {Genomic datasets often consist of large, binary, sparse data matrices. In such a dataset, one is often interested in finding contiguous blocks that (mostly) contain ones. This is a biclustering problem, and while many algorithms have been proposed to deal with gene expression data, only two algorithms have been proposed that specifically deal with binary matrices. None of the gene expression biclustering algorithms can handle the large number of zeros in sparse binary matrices. The two proposed binary algorithms failed to produce meaningful results. In this article, we present a new algorithm that is able to extract biclusters from sparse, binary datasets. A powerful feature is that biclusters with different numbers of rows and columns can be detected, varying from many rows to few columns and few rows to many columns. It allows the user to guide the search towards biclusters of specific dimensions. When applying our algorithm to an input matrix derived from TRANSFAC, we find transcription factors with distinctly dissimilar binding motifs, but a clear set of common targets that are significantly enriched for GO categories.},

The exponent v is closely related to the fractal dimension and the information dimension, but its computation is considerably easier. Its usefulness in characterizing experimental data which stem from very high dimensional systems is stressed. Algorithms for extracting v from the time series of a single variable are proposed. The relations between the various measures of strange attractors and between them and the Lyapunov exponents are discussed. It is shown that the conjecture of Kaplan and Yorke for the dimension gives an upper bound for v. Various examples of finite and infinite dimensional systems are treated, both numerically and analytically.},

Test cases reveal that this simple algorithm has benefits over classic direct and gradient-based methods and particle swarm in speed of finding the optimum and in handling surface aberrations, including ridges, multi-optima, and stochastic objective functions. Potential limitations and analysis opportunities are discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Screening and diagnostic tests are common in the fields of psychology, medicine, and education. Often there are several competing tests, and decisions must be made about the relative accuracy of those tests. This article describes a general measure that can be used for both continuous and dichotomous outcome measures. It is the standardized distance between the means of the 2 populations. For continuous measures, it is the effect size measure. For dichotomous measures, it is proportional to the logarithm of the odds of the sensitivity plus the logarithm of the odds of the specificity. The measure is easily computed for both kinds of outcomes. Properties of this measure are discussed, and examples are given. Ths use of this measure to compare the average performance of different tests is described.},

abstract = {Software development effort estimation is the process of predicting the most realistic use of effort required for developing software based on some parameters. It has always characterised one of the biggest challenges in Computer Science for the last decades. Because time and cost estimate at the early stages of the software development are the most difficult to obtain, and they are often the least accurate. Traditional algorithmic techniques such as regression models, Software Life Cycle Management (SLIM), COCOMO model, function points, etc, require an estimation process in a long term. But, nowadays that is not acceptable for software developers and companies. Newer soft computing techniques to effort estimation based on non-algorithmic techniques such as Fuzzy Logic (FL) may offer an alternative for solving the problem. This work aims to propose a fuzzy logic realistic model to achieve more accuracy in software effort estimation. In this innovative model, by applying fuzzy logic and using training procedure to the system, the accuracy of the results is desirable in comparison with the famous traditional algorithmic technique, COCOMO II model. This novelty model will lead researchers to focus on non-algorithmic models to overcome the estimation problems. Our validation experiment was carried out on artificial dataset as well as the COCOMO standard dataset.},

abstract = {In this article we describe an ongoing effort to integrate information visualization techniques into the process of configuration management for software systems. Our focus is to help software engineers manage the evolution of large and complex software systems by offering them effective and efficient ways to query and assess system properties using visual techniques. To this end, we combine several techniques from different domains, as follows. First, we construct an infrastructure that allows generic querying and data mining of different types of software repositories such as CVS and Subversion. Using this infrastructure, we construct several models of the software source code evolution at different levels of detail, ranging from project and package up to function and code line. Second, we describe a set of views that allow examining the code evolution models at different levels of detail and from different perspectives. We detail three views: the file view shows changes at line level across many versions of a single, or a few, files. The project view shows changes at file level across entire software projects. The decomposition view shows changes at subsystem level across entire projects. We illustrate how the proposed techniques, which we implemented in a fully operational toolset, have been used to answer non-trivial questions on several real-world, industry-size software projects. Our work is at the crossroads of applied software engineering (SE) and information visualization, as our toolset aims to tightly integrate the methods promoted by the InfoVis field into the SE practice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many proposed statistical measures can efficiently compare protein sequence to further infer protein structure, function and evolutionary information. They share the same idea of using k-word frequencies of protein sequences. Given a protein sequence, the information on its related protein sequences hasn't been used for protein sequence comparison until now. This paper proposed a scheme to construct protein 'sequence space' which was associated with protein sequences related to the given protein, and the performances of statistical measures were compared when they explored the information on protein 'sequence space' or not. This paper also presented two statistical measures for protein: gre.k (generalized relative entropy) and gsm.k (gapped similarity measure). RESULTS: We tested statistical measures based on protein 'sequence space' or not with three data sets. This not only offers the systematic and quantitative experimental assessment of these statistical measures, but also naturally complements the available comparison of statistical measures based on protein sequence. Moreover, we compared our statistical measures with alignment-based measures and the existing statistical measures. The experiments were grouped into two sets. The first one, performed via ROC (Receiver Operating Curve) analysis, aims at assessing the intrinsic ability of the statistical measures to discriminate and classify protein sequences. The second set of the experiments aims at assessing how well our measure does in phylogenetic analysis. Based on the experiments, several conclusions can be drawn and, from them, novel valuable guidelines for the use of protein 'sequence space' and statistical measures were obtained. CONCLUSION: Alignment-based measures have a clear advantage when the data is high redundant. The more efficient statistical measure is the novel gsm.k introduced by this article, the cos.k followed. When the data becomes less redundant, gre.k proposed by us achieves a better performance, but all the other measures perform poorly on classification tasks. Almost all the statistical measures achieve improvement by exploring the information on 'sequence space' as word's length increases, especially for less redundant data. The reasonable results of phylogenetic analysis confirm that Gdis.k based on 'sequence space' is a reliable measure for phylogenetic analysis. In summary, our quantitative analysis verifies that exploring the information on 'sequence space' is a promising way to improve the abilities of statistical measures for protein comparison.},

@article{Berezovski2006a,
abstract = {Aptamers are typically selected from libraries of random DNA (or RNA) sequences through systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), which involves several rounds of alternating steps of partitioning of candidate oligonucleotides and their PCR amplification. Here we describe a protocol for non-SELEX selection of aptamers--a process that involves repetitive steps of partitioning with no amplification between them. Non-equilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM), which is a highly efficient affinity method, is used for partitioning. NECEEM also facilitates monitoring of bulk affinity of enriched libraries at every step of partitioning and screening of individual clones for their affinity to the target. NECEEM allows all clones to be screened prior to sequencing, so that only clones with suitable binding parameters are sequenced. The entire protocol can be completed in 1 wk, whereas conventional SELEX protocols take several weeks even in a specialized industrial facility.},

@article{Takahashi2006a,
abstract = {Models for numerical simulations should be described in a coherent style. They are expected to have consistencies at the causal dependency level. However, System Dynamics causal loop diagrams can have inconsistencies. This diagram style’s arrows, concerning flow and stock relationships, can have the opposite direction of stock flow diagrams which can numerically simulate models. These inconsistencies can cause inappropriate qualitative simulations so that it is sometimes recommended to use stock flow diagrams instead of causal loop diagrams even for qualitative simulations. However, causal loop diagrams have merits in their use. Causal loop diagrams are intuitively easy to draw and read. If causal loop diagrams are given information about each variable’s dynamic property, they can be changed to stock flow diagrams and simulation models can be generated. This paper suggests how to use causal loop diagrams as a starting point in numerical simulation research.},

abstract = {The framework of multiobjective optimization is used to tackle the unsupervised learning problem, data clustering, following a formulation first proposed in the statistics literature. The conceptual advantages of the multiobjective formulation are discussed and an evolutionary approach to the problem is developed. The resulting algorithm, multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination, is compared with a number of well-established single-objective clustering algorithms, a modern ensemble technique, and two methods of model selection. The experiments demonstrate that the conceptual advantages of multiobjective clustering translate into practical and scalable performance benefits},
